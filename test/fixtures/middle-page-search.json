Although there are important differences between the three \u201ckinds\u201d of data , there is also a rich ecosystem of ideas, innovation and ultimately social and commercial opportunity emerging in the spaces where they overlap. But how do businesses make returns with open data? The answer begins by mining it! Consider Climate Corporation\u2019s massive disruption of the US farming insurance market and subsequent \u00a31bn exit at the end of last year. Its business began with \u2018digging about in open data dirt\u2019 and convened the smartest Silicon Valley data scientists (co-incidentally exploiting the same clojure tech stack as our very own Mastodon C ). Surely other parts of the insurance industry are ripe for similar transformation? I would love to see open environmental, social and economic data combine with telematics data to help sort out the stale mess that UK car insurance premiums are in. Here is a space where personal data privacy could be really be debated. Imagine a dynamic monthly insurance premium fluctuating in line with risks assessed using open data sources and personal driving data - Citroen is already looking at this. So open data is there to be used, for social, environmental and economic gains. The business case for publishing open data is gathering momentum. For example, our June 2013 research Show me the money (carried out in collaboration with the Bank of England) brought to the fore (and the front page of the FT ) a showcase example. Using anonymous aggregate customer data sourced from the three largest UK peer-to-peer lending businesses, we proved a healthy market has been developing throughout the downturn, serving the needs of consumers and small businesses at a time when traditional lenders are not. For those businesses leading new financial services, open data offers a credible and highly defensible path to \u2018data intensive but prescriptively light\u2019 regulation, providing consumers and investors with a deeper level of transparency and an opportunity to invest with greater confidence. Open data applied more broadly in finance has huge potential to help businesses keep nimble, honest and highly competitive. Let\u2019s hope that 2014 sees the growth of more open finance and raises the transparency bar. Show me the Money is an example of how greater openness might deliver competitive advantage in one sector but there are multiple reasons why for profit businesses can and should publish open data: Openly outsourcing research and development: a unique, fast and inexpensive way to get your hands on expert outside help. Kaggle is using this approach in data science to investigate information challenges and opportunities. Look to reward and engage people for finding opportunities and errors. (Not everyone has a $100,000 prize fund like Microsoft, but incentives work on a smaller scale too!). Open data procurement: as Nike opened up their supply chain data, their reputation improved and suppliers became more competitive on price and quality. In the same way that governments open data, businesses could open up their spending data. There would be no need to name the suppliers but the market could use the data freely to compete. Open data product data: publishing product information as open data can help to extend and better syndicate the reach of products and services making it easier for partners and customers to embed, link to and curate company data. Open data reputation: publishing frequent and relevant data on a company\u2019s business activities helps to prove it is serious about being a better citizen. 2014 will be a year when more big businesses embrace openness. The question they will need to address is not whether they should publish open data but how and when. I look forward to helping them find the answers!

This helps us measure how well we\u2019re doing against our metrics, and ensures we have a list of people in the office in case of a fire. Using open technologies and standards has enabled us to expand this system to meet the needs of the space and the people working within. If you have visited the ODI then you will have inevitably come across our electronic sign-in that greets you as soon as you\u0002exit the lift. This system has proved very effective and allows us to assess our impact both on a local and global scale. The main physical presence comes in the form of an iPad loaded with the ready-made Sign In application. While not an open source application, at the time this was the only suitable application, in any mobile store, able to be quickly customised and allow extraction of the data. The sign in system with current visitors displayed on the screens in the background The Sign In application is able to be run on multiple iPads, each located at different entrances and exists on your building. So that a visitor can enter via one entrance and exit via another, the application synchronises its data using a series of XML files passed between each device. Thus in order to extract the data in real time (rather than receive a summary email once a day), we built a program to emulate an iPad and which simply receives the data like it is just another device. One script later and we have piped all the data into the visitor system database ready to used by other parts of the system. As we move forward, it is intended that this proprietary part of the system be replaced with an open source solution built on top of the platform that has evolved in the last six months. However in the time allowed, we are very appreciative for the pre-built application and are happy to share our experiences of extracting your data from the application\u2019s closed wall architecture. It soon became clear that entering details on a touch screen each time you visit does not create the best experience, especially for staff that are in the office on a daily basis. The initial solution to this problem involved complementing the sign-in system with a web interface when people can simply click their picture to sign in and out of the office each day. While this worked for some time, during one of our 20% weeks , I decided to investigate the potential of using an RFID card reader to allow people to simply touch in and out of the office using one of the many cards we carry in our wallets. In order to both save the environment and space in peoples wallets we don\u2019t issue an RFID card. Using an off-the-shelf MiFare 1K card reader allows people to associate many different cards to their profile including Oyster, ITSO and contactless payment cards. 1 Using a contactless card read has dramatically reduced the effort required to sign in and out and also improved the quality of the data. Making the process so simple has encouraged people to touch in and out at lunchtime in addition to either end of the day. Although it is still unconfirmed if the increase in data is somehow linked to the Star Trek computer sounds that play when you touch in and out. System architecture of the ODI sign in system \u0002 The diagram above shows the architecture of the system. As should be evident, the system is very modular and all the different parts\u0002communicate with the processor node using an Application Programming Interface (API) based upon the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as intended by our illustrious director . The Star Trek computer sounds are directly mapped to the HTTP status codes that best represent each one 2 . By building a modular system that re-uses a lot of existing technology, including the RFID card we all carry, introduces a huge cost saving of purchasing a complex electronic visitor system. Our aim in the near future is to replace the dependency on the closed source iPad application. This way the whole system can be run using a Raspberry Pi , cheaper tablet and an RFID card reader. This brings the cost of the entire system into the sub \u00a3400 bracket 3 . This will also mean that we can continue to expand the system to allow assignment of desk space and allow all visitors to associate RFID cards. If you want to deploy your own system then all the code modules are available on\u0002 GitHub . For more information you can contact the ODI tech team on tech@theodi.org or join our IRC channel (#theodi on irc.freenode.net) <sup>1</sup> Before people start worrying that we can make charges to your Oyster and Bank cards, this is not possible. Contactless cards all contain a generic serial number put on by the manufacturer and this number is not associated with the use of the card, so although we collect this number so you can sign in and out of the ODI quickly, it is not possible for us to tell what type of card you used, only that you have one. <sup>2</sup> Finding codes for some sounds proved a real challenge, e.g. 418 <sup>3</sup> Based upon the tablet being a Nexus 10 or iPad 2.","slug":"odi-experience-data-moment-you-walk","tag_ids":["blog","odi"],"format":"blog","created_at":"2013-05-29T11:47:15+01:00"}},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/curatorial-statement.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/curatorial-statement","title":"Curatorial Statement","details":{"description":"Data is driving decisions that shape our daily lives: from friends to governments, we are becoming more reliant on connected data. Global opinion is increasingly communicated through data-driven visuals. Personal well-being, sentiment and influence are continually monitored through data-harvesting devices. Knowledge at all levels and on all topics can be handed to anyone, at any time. Open data is shaping our society. In curating the showcase for the ODI we wanted to select a range of works that would not just reflect different data sources, but that would challenge our understanding of what data is, and how it may affect and reflect our lives. We were privileged in the breadth of content and the quality of work that was submitted as part of the open call, allowing for scope to select works that could comment on, complement and challenge perceptions in a coherent collection. The works range from geomagnetic data visualisations, to wall painted cellular automata, to tabloid newspapers of search term trend graphs - all tangible interventions into the mass accretion of data around us. In Phil Archer\u2019s work data comes from the depths of time, as symbolic representations of solar eclipses dating from 2137 BCE to 1991 CE are sketched in ultraviolet light. In contrast, \u2018The SKOR Codex\u2019 looks to preserve data for the distant future. The book, printed by La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme, contains encoded binary information that has been carefully fabricated to last for over 1,000 years. The works span space as well as time, in \u201820Hz\u2019, geo-magnetic storm measurements are taken from the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, while \u2018Metrography\u2019 portrays the London Underground transit map as a spatial reality - data defining specious geography. In \u2018Still Lifes and Oscillators 1\u2019 the mistreatment of image data by reformatting, reducing, and regenerating, questions the representation of visual data as the ultra-processed image, as the final stable state from a cellular automata cycle is painted back onto the space it was captured from. Real-time environmental data is embodied in Stanza\u2019s life-size sculpture assembled from computer components and acrylic slices of his own physique. In \u2018Body 01000010011011110110010001111001\u2019 the urban environment provides a dynamic flickering and clicking sentience to the otherwise inert structure, reflecting the personal level of influence data has on an individual, whereas Martin John Callanan\u2019s \u2018Text Trends\u2019 reflects our actions en masse. Works by Ellie Harrison and Fabio Lattanzi Antinori embody the current global political environment that is in constant flux, barely noticed on a personal scale, but that potentially have significant consequences for each of us. As data becomes more accessible to artists, as it opens up for use as a raw material, we are seeing more of its integration into works that explore environmental socio-political and economic aspects of society. By utilising data in an experiential way, this selection of works pulls data out of the virtual domain and into our physical world. We hope the exhibition provokes discussion around what open data is, how it informs and affects us, and how we interpret it in a way that is meaningful. MzTEK worked with the ODI to encourage a broad spectrum of applicants, and in the interest of openness we will release the demographic data from the submission process. We would like to thank the ODI for all the support we have received, and for co-creating this with us. Finally, we would like to thank all of the artists involved for their thought provoking works and their professionalism in the production of this collection.

Phil , our Digital Production Editor, handles loads of video, audio, photography, and so on, and because a lot of it is rather large, his laptop threatens to bust its seams on a regular basis. So, he walked over and asked if there was anything the tech team knew of that would give him more space to work with. Of course, it wasn\u2019t quite as simple as just having a load of disk space. This is important stuff, so backup is important, and ideally we should be able to access it from the outside. We also have no system administrator (or air conditioning in the server room), so it couldn\u2019t be anything that needed much maintenance. We\u2019d heard of things like the Amazon Storage Gateway , and the idea of local storage backed by infinite cloud storage was very appealing. However, we don\u2019t use AWS; instead, we love Rackspace . Not only are they one of our sponsors , but they\u2019re big on open source , and their London data centre runs on 100% renewable energy , all of which make us happy. Unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t anything around that we could use as a storage appliance backed by Rackspace Cloudfiles, which was a problem. Then, we realised - using a little bit of code and some cheap hardware, we could make our own! So, this is Philbot. It\u2019s pretty simple, hardware wise. It\u2019s a Raspberry Pi with a 2TB Seagate USB hard disk attached, which it shares over the network using the usual network drive protocols. All in all, under a \u00a3100. Not bad. The magic is in the software. We\u2019re a Ruby shop mostly, and there are some amazing open source gems out there that let us do most of this really easily. Firstly, our code uses the Listen gem to watch the filesystem and detect when things change. The idea is that when real Phil saves a file onto Philbot\u2019s disk, the script will notice. If a file is added, modified, or deleted, then it\u2019s placed onto a queue (using Resque ). That queue is processed in the background, and the file is uploaded or removed from Cloudfiles as appropriate using the fog gem. All in all, it\u2019s really very little code, mostly just glue to connect together the parts. It\u2019s all test driven with Cucumber as well, another of our favourite tools. At this point, it works. Human Phil can save files on a large network drive, and they will be instantly backed up to Cloudfiles. If he deletes them, they will be removed from Cloudfiles as well. In future, we want to add a function to \u201cfreeze\u201d directories, which removes them from the local storage but leaves them in the cloud for long-term cold storage. There are some other future plans; we want to make the configuration of the device itself operate using a network drive with a configuration file on it, and then create a Raspberry Pi OS image with it all preconfigured, so that you can just plug it in and get going. That\u2019s in the future though; for now it\u2019s handling our day to day needs nicely. So, if you would like to have your own cloud storage appliance for less than a hundred quid, why not take a look at the detailed setup instructions in the Philbot repository on GitHub . Let us know how you get on!","slug":"introducing-philbot","tag_ids":["odi","blog"],"format":"blog","created_at":"2014-05-06T09:39:27+01:00"}},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/about-us.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/about-us","title":"About the ODI","details":{"description":"The Open Data Institute is catalysing the evolution of open data culture to create economic, environmental, and social value.

Given these prospects, the UK higher education sector is already starting to get on board. A number of universities ( Southampton , Oxford , and the Open University , to name a few) have taken on the agenda, and are rapidly developing tools and practices. Sector agencies and bodies such as JISC (Joint Information Systems Committee), HESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency), the Research Councils , and the Royal Society are also working in the same direction. Universities UK is also leading work on open data. We are particularly pleased to announce the launch today of a joint programme with the Open Data Institute . A number of universities and partner organisations have already signed up to the programme, which will increase capacity, develop and share good practice as well as devise new tools and services for universities. We anticipate that others will join over the course of the next few months, as the programme is rolled out more widely. This is our challenge (and our opportunity) to demonstrate the rewards of open data. There are a number of advantages in open data and three of these positive prospects are outlined below. Firstly, increased efficiency. Universities UK has been leading a programme of work which supports efficiency and modernisation in the university sector. Open data can play a key role in this. Releasing data on, for example, procurement costs, energy costs and usage, or space utilisation will allow institutions to benchmark one another and drive down costs. There may also be opportunities through transferring good practice from one part of the sector to another. Secondly, improved student services. Opening up institutional data on admission, provision and progression can improve student choice, as potential students are able to draw on a wider range of data to make more informed choices. From the institutional point of view, opening up their own data and combining them with open data from external sources can help improve the targeting of marketing and recruitment activities. And finally, access to research. There is a strong push to make research data more open and widely-available. Open data not only helps the research process by allowing researchers to build more rapidly on the work of others, but can potentially contribute to economic growth through widening opportunities for exploitation. Some academic domains are already leading this field, such as the galaxy zoo project that is publishing data from space telescopes to enable volunteers to help classify the millions of galaxies that have been pictured. Fields such as genomics are also going down the open data route though initiatives such as the personal genomic project. Whilst there are plenty of opportunities arising from open data, there are also challenges and risks. Capacity and infrastructure need to be developed which will require investment. Institutions will need to overcome concerns about competition and information exchange. There are also other considerations, including the need to protect the sector\u2019s information assets from cyber-attack, allied to issues of privacy and data protection. As part of this work we are running a series of seminars on open data which will continue into the autumn, culminating in a conference. There will also be further UUK outputs on this topic along the way, so watch this space. The potential benefits of open data are already starting to show. And with the help of all organisations and universities involved, together with a facilitating environment encouraged by government policy and technology adoption, open data will accelerate developments substantially.

With its official opening just over two weeks away, The ODI hosted its second public hackathon aimed at unlocking the value of open data. The brief was to explore the future of personal data - a future in which consumers will have easy access to information collected about them by businesses A crowd of committed developers, designers, and data experts gathered at ODI HQ to explore the possibilities offered by this challenging and controversial data environment. Personal data revealed In preparation for the event, dozens of friends and supporters agreed to donate their personal (but anonymous) data, ranging from financial information to loyalty card transactions. This was collated and processed into machine-readable formats so that participants could use it, review it, and explore opportunities. Launching the event, CEO, Gavin Starks said that The ODI is hoping\u0002to empower people to make a difference: \u201cI see open data like the web in 1994 when all we knew was that there was a big thing about to happen. We didn\u2019t know what shape it would take but we knew it was going to be exciting and transformative.\u0002That is very much what I see now in the open data culture. The word culture is very important. It is not about tech, or business, but developing a movement\u201d. MiData The event was held in collaboration with organisations including BIS , Ctrl-Shift , Consumer Focus , O2 , import.io , NHS Information Centre , Tictrac , Aimia and MyDex. MiData is an initiative that aims to give consumers access to their personal data in a portable and electronic format with the assurance of anonymity. But it will only be useful to people if the data that\u2019s gathered stimulates innovation and this weekend was all about generating ideas Winning Teams Over 48 hours, \u0002participants worked on propositions that could, potentially, transform peoples\u2019 lives and result in new products and services. On Sunday afternoon, teams presented their ideas to a judging panel including ODI founder and Chair of the Government\u2019s MiData Programme, Prof Nigel Shadbolt. They included: **MyLoan **which turned the idea of anonymity on its head by proposing that people flaunt their data for commercial profit and use it to get a loan, mortgage or credit rating **What do I buy that makes me happy? **which analyses shopping transactions and then plots them against social media activity, including sentiment scores to see how happy you really are after you buy that \u00a320 moisturiser or that gadget for your car. **emPowerMi **a tool to show tangible financial savings through energy efficiencies that are specific to your personal circumstances. Enrich my \u00a3ife a method to crowd source richer and more useful descriptions of the data we receive in statements and receipts. Next Steps The awesome energy and ideas generated during the event meant there was no overall winner but all the teams came away with prizes. Judge and ODI Chairman, Prof Nigel Shadbolt said: \u201cThe results from the Midata hackathon demonstrate the value in personal data and the value of The ODI in providing a space and the resources to innovate with it. We saw apps to shrink your energy bills, secure appropriate loans, apps to enrich your data, tools to analyse it and even a method to find the acquisitions that make you happy.\u201d Watch this space for a guest blog from one of the phenomenal teams, emPowerMi \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002","slug":"inspiration-personal-data-odi-s-midata-hackathon","tag_ids":["news","odi"],"format":"news","created_at":"2012-11-20T18:27:34+00:00"}},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/long-held-ambition-realised-odi-opens-officially.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/long-held-ambition-realised-odi-opens-officially","title":"A long-held ambition realised as the ODI opens officially","details":{"description":"Today is the official launch of the ODI and we\u2019ll be welcoming both Francis Maude and David Willetts as our guests. Support at the very highest levels of Government has been crucial not just for the ODI but for the success of open data efforts in the UK. Tim Berners-Lee and I were appointed by the previous Government to begin a process of releasing government public data. We had our portal data.gov.uk running in 5 months with its first data sets. Beta sites and agile development, open source and open innovation - these were new concepts to government. Tim and I were asked to join others on the Transparency Board and to continue advising on Open Data. The commitment to open data, featured large in the Conservative Party\u2019s Technology Manifesto and in this Governments work \u2013 with real and substantial achievements in policy and practice. So the UK has been fortunate to have Governments from across the political divide that have understood the importance of open data. I make this point because open data must not, should not and so far has not been a matter of partisan politics. The development of open data in the UK is something all the major parties can be proud of. Benefits for the Public I have said before that open data is a public good; it is a public good just like clean air and clean water. \u0002And many benefits flow from this public good. For example, transparency and accountability. When the infection rates in our hospitals are published as open data, this data holds those institutions accountable. Those that perform poorly have to look to their laurels. Since the data on infection rates were published there has been an 85% decrease in patients infected with MRSA. And it costs \u00a39000 to treat a patient wit MRSA, so open data is making hospitals more efficient, it is saving money. We can\u2019t lay all of this improvement at the door of open data but when people can see the difference between the best and the worst it drives a sharing of best practice; people look to understand the differences and strive to do better. Open data of this sort is also a social good in and of itself. Engaging Open Data Open data can lead to engagement and participation. Every month police forces in England and Wales publish their reported crime data, by type and location. The first month following the publication of this data saw significant increases in calls to the police offering additional information on those reported crimes. Open data can create economic value.. Just how much may not yet be exactly quantifiable but all the evidence is in one direction. From insurance to intelligent procurement, transport to health, companies are beginning to sense the economic opportunity. The shape of this new market is outlined in the Deloitte research on which we collaborated. Economic value creation is one of the main reasons we are here today. But there is no one reason to do open data, there are many. There is no one benefit, there are many. \u0002This is why it is important to maintain and extend the publication of open data. This why the Government\u2019s continued commitment to open data is so important - and it is why the ODI is so important. Beginnings The ODI had its genesis in conversations Tim and I had with No 10. He and I believed that there was the opportunity to create a world class centre to help pull through the UK\u2019s expertise and leadership in this area. The Chancellor announced funding in last year\u2019s Autumn Statement for an Open Data Institute to be established in Shoreditch with Government providing \u00a310m over 5 years via the Technology Strategy Board(TSB), and the ODI to raise matched funding over this same time period. The TSB needed a detailed plan before they could enter in to an agreement. A good part of my life from December through April was spent creating a blueprint for the ODI and writing that plan. I\u2019d like to express now my thanks to those who helped and gave advice \u2013 Tim Kelsey, Pete Lawrence and Olivia Burman from the Cabinet Office; Iain Gray, David Bott and Hadley Beaman from the TSB \u2013 and many others. When the plan was approved all we had to do was set up the ODI. this was a brand new entity. We had a plan but no premises, no people and no trading history. Yet we had the right idea. And here we owe a debt of gratitude to the University of Southampton and its Vice Chancellor Don Nutbeam. They provided access to their estates and legal teams. They paid for a project manager before the funding agreement was in place. They did this because they believed in open data. Project Management The Project Manager I hired to help me is someone the ODI owes a particular debt of thanks to. Tim Organ was magnificent. We spent many hours looking for the right place. We believed that being in the right place and in the right space were essential. We wanted an open and collaborative feel. A world without walls but with private space. We believe we have a special space here in Clifton Street. As the space developed we needed to find the right management team. We have in Gavin Starks, Jeni Tennison and Stuart Coulman \u0002a management team with flair, energy, talent and ambition. As the ODI has expanded and our team grown so too has my excitement about what we might achieve. Catalysing a New Industry We are in fact fashioning a new infrastructure \u2013 a data infrastructure every bit as essential as the servers, the fibre, the radio spectrum and the mobile networks that store and distribute it. Open data on health, transport, crime, and the environment. Open data on companies, contracts, spending and procurement. Open data on the energy we produce and consume. Open geospatial data and open demographic data. All of this has value when it becomes actionable information, when it delivers a service that a citizen can use or a consumer wants. Data has value when it enables a business or department to improve itself, its products and processes. Much of the value of open data is how it adds value to other kinds of data; open and closed, personal and non-personal. I Chair the midata programme for BIS which is all about giving each of us access to the data that companies collect when we interact with them. Recently we organised a weekend hackathon at the ODI exploring the opportunities of a midata world. It must be right that this access extends to the data that Government holds about us (our tax and welfare data, education and health data) by putting citizens at the heart of their own information we could effect a transformation,\u0002one that holds the key to the effective delivery of government services to citizens. Training At the ODI we are committed to training the next generation of public technologists. We will work with the public sector to make the data it publishes as good as possible. We will train data entrepreneurs who want to build new companies and new services using this data. We will work with existing corporates to realise the value in open data. We want to ensure our work has the widest national and international impact. I believe that the best way to ensure that open data flourishes is to: build a vibrant demand side that uses, depends and relies on open data; harness its power for innovation and value creation and, of course; to realise the talents and ambitions of the Open Data Institute.
