We know it&rsquo;s great for collaborating on code (millions of people and thousands of teams use it every day), but can it be used for data too?</p>\n\n<p>When we collaborate on code, we use the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html\">Github flow model</a>, that is we work on some code, write tests, then open a pull request to merge the code into the main codebase. We use <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travis-ci.org\">Travis</a> to run our tests, and, if the tests pass, the code gets merged.</p>\n\n<p>This works really well for us, but translating this to data is a different matter. Generally when you collaborate on data, we don&rsquo;t have an automated way of checking the data is in the correct format before any pull requests are merged.</p>\n\n<p>This got me thinking, after our work on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/\">CSVlint</a>, we now have a way of not only checking the formatting of data, but also checking if it matches a schema. Could we use the code we&rsquo;ve already written to use <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travis-ci.org\">Travis</a> to test the data and use a similar flow to our code?</p>\n\n<p>I decided to use my innovation time to find out - the result is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/cid\">Cid</a>, a Ruby script which validates data in a Github repo, and can generate a new <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/\">Datapackage</a> and push this to Github automatically if the validation is sucessful. If you&rsquo;re interested in the nuts and bolts of it, you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/cid/blob/master/README.md\">read the README</a>, but I&rsquo;d like to use this blog post to ask for your help to test it out.</p>\n\n<p>As we know, at the time of writing, voting in the UK European Elections took place yesterday. The count won&rsquo;t take place until Sunday night, so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to try out Cid, and see what collaborating on data in real time looks like.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve set up a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections\">repo in Github</a> which will contain the data. There&rsquo;s detailed instructions on how to submit your data <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections/blob/gh-pages/README.md\">in the Readme</a> (it assumes at least some knowledge of Github, but you don&rsquo;t need to be a developer to submit some data). </p>\n\n<p>If you fancy helping, I&rsquo;ve listed the regions <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections/issues?labels=help+wanted%2CRegions&amp;page=1&amp;state=open\">on Github here</a>, and added a link to where the results will be published (according to the Electoral Commision&rsquo;s website) - please comment on the region you&rsquo;re planning to submit data for, and once the results are announced, check that council&rsquo;s website for the results, add them to a spreadsheet and submit a pull request.</p>\n\n<p>Although the European Commission are planning to publish open data on the election results themselves, I&rsquo;m hoping this will be a nice proof of concept for wider publication of collaborative open data, as well as a starting point for something around next year&rsquo;s general election, which, so far, has never had a single point of reference for open data.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections/issues\">open an issue on GitHub</a> or comment below.

Using Paul Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s brilliant <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/paulfitz/daff\">daff</a> library, I put CSV diffs into GitLab (an open source GitHub clone), but then again most people aren&rsquo;t using that.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after this, GitHub added CSV viewing support in their web interface, which is fantastic, but still doesn&rsquo;t handle changes well.</p>\n\n<p>Well, this week was innovation week again, and my colleague Stuart came up with the suggestion of putting the CSV diff capability we did for GitLab into a browser plugin that would work on the main GitHub site. This seemed like an excellent idea.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it was pretty easy, and version 1.0.0 is now released!

It is a tremendous achievement to ignite the public discussion around inequality, especially in the US.</p>\n\n<p>The book is so promising, some argue &ldquo;Nobel-prize worthy&rdquo;, because it uses historic data such as tax records \u2013 contrary to ungrounded economic theory. Mr Piketty shows in great detail how inequality evolved over the past 300 years. He writes &ldquo;[the] debate about the distribution of wealth has long been based on an abundance of prejudice and a paucity of fact.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This is the great power of data: it undermines purely ideological arguments. As we shape the world\u2019s politics with data, transparency and open access are paramount. Even though the data behind the book is public, it is not open. We would love to see a clear licence, better dissemination and simpler formats to enable everyone to engage in the debate around growing inequality.</p>\n\n<h3>What&rsquo;s in the book?</h3>\n\n<p>Thomas Piketty\u2019s opus magnum includes three major contributions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Piketty collected and analysed historic data and shows in great detail how inequality evolved over the past 300 years.</li>\n  <li>He develops the theoretical ideas of why capitalism has a tendency towards the concentration of wealth and how economies will evolve over time.</li>\n  <li>As an \u201cutopian\u201d solution he proposes a progressive global tax on capital (=wealth).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Among the raving reviews, the book has, not surprisingly, attracted <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21601567-wonky-book-inequality-becomes-blockbuster-bigger-marx\">criticsm</a>. However, even free-market economists have <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/first-thoughts-on-piketty.html\">praised</a> Piketty&rsquo;s foray into the data and history of wealth, whereas the most ardent critics, e.g. a fund manager, simply ignore his &ldquo;<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303825604579515452952131592\">blizzard of data</a>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>At its core, Piketty offers a compelling explanation of the, what MIT professor <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1987/solow.jpg\">Robert Solow</a> calls, \u201crich-get-richer dynamic\u201d. He attacks the political right and financial elites with no hesitation. Surprisingly, they have no real answer to his claims that the current trends towards more inequality are detrimental. The data gives Piketty an almost undisputed case, but others need to be able to use it to, to perform their own analyses and double-check Piketty&rsquo;s claims. </p>\n\n<h3>Where is the data?</h3>\n\n<p>It is highly commendable that Thomas Piketty publishes the underlying Excel files and also the original sources on his <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://piketty.pse.ens.fr\">academic site</a>. If you are search-savvy, you can find the data behind the book in a more accessible format on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.quandl.com/piketty-codes\">Quandl</a>, a data catalogue.</p>\n\n<p>The main source for income data is a dedicated and growing website, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://topincomes.g-mond.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/\">World Top Incomes Database</a> curated by Piketty and three colleagues. There is a similar dataset at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.lisdatacenter.org/\">Luxembourg Income Study Database (LIS)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Versions of the World Top Incomes Database, such as a full dump on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://datahub.io/dataset/world-top-incomes-database\">datahub.io</a>, can be found on third-party sites. However, we recommend using the original source because it has the most up-to-date data and acknowledges the work that goes into collecting the data.</p>\n\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the problem?</h3>\n\n<p>None of this data is explicitly open for everyone to reuse, clearly licenced and in machine-readable formats.</p>\n\n<p>The data on Piketty&rsquo;s site is buried in the French section only, and full of cumbersome file formats. There is no licensing information on this site to indicate how the data can be reused, nor on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.quandl.com/piketty-codes\">Quandl copy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The results of a major data collection exercise, the rights to the World Top Incomes Database are clear in the copyright statement &ldquo;\u00a9 The World Top Incomes Database.&rdquo; In the absence of an open licence it cannot be used without explicit consent. The availability of downloads and the described terms of attribution implicitly encourage re-use, but without a licence it&rsquo;s not clear whether this is permitted only for research purposes or more widely.</p>\n\n<p>The website and data formats are optimised for humans, with Excel files and point-and-click data selection menus. This is very useful for a quick overview or a specific analysis; a broader use case, however, is virtually impossible without machine-readable data.</p>\n\n<p>In the Luxembourg Income Study Database (LIS), bar for some reports, you only get access to the data if you have a researcher&rsquo;s account. Moreover, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.lisdatacenter.org/about-lis/terms-of-use/\">LIS Microdata User Agreement</a> states, among others, the following terms:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>to use the microdata only for scholarly, research, or educational purposes</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>never to use the microdata for commercial purposes;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The data are <em>not open for everyone</em>. The Upshot, the New York Times\u2019 new data journalism site, published an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html\">interactive version</a> of different income distributions. To make this happen, they had to directly collaborate with the LIS team. </p>\n\n<h3>What next, Mr Piketty?</h3>\n\n<p>We have a few suggestions that would strengthen the book\u2019s cause.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Make the data from your book and in the World Top Incomes Database open using a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a> attribution licence to give users more confidence in how they can use the data</li>\n  <li>Provide a full data dump for the World Top Incomes Database</li>\n  <li>Create a set of interactive web graphics that are more engaging than those in the book. Or let others &ldquo;start <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/656514-thomas-pikettys-improbable-data/\">touching up the charts</a> like models in Vogue&rdquo; and feature them</li>\n  <li>Publish more details on the prediction models and how to replicate them or create your own scenarios</li>\n  <li>Share the data, metadata and academic sources in machine-readable formats</li>\n  <li>Go through the process of creating an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificate</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We believe, then, the success of <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> will doubtless continue. It will inspire others to contribute to the data collection, allow more people to see the facts about inequality and give those in political spheres the arguments for change.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Ulrich Atz","slug":"ulrich-atz","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/ulrich-atz","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Ulrich Atz","slug":"ulrich-atz","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/ulrich-atz","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-leeds-goes-live.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-leeds-goes-live","slug":"odi-leeds-goes-live","title":"ODI Leeds goes live","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:39:06+01:00","created_at":"2014-05-06T14:22:06+01:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"ODI Leeds, one of 18 ODI Nodes around the world, officially opens its doors for business today (6th May).

So, he walked over and asked if there was anything the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ukoditech\">tech team</a> knew of that would give him more space to work with.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t quite as simple as just having a load of disk space. This is important stuff, so backup is important, and ideally we should be able to access it from the outside. We also have no system administrator (or air conditioning in the server room), so it couldn&rsquo;t be anything that needed much maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;d heard of things like the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/\">Amazon Storage Gateway</a>, and the idea of local storage backed by infinite cloud storage was very appealing. However, we don&rsquo;t use AWS; instead, we love <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rackspace.co.uk\">Rackspace</a>. Not only are they one of our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://directory.theodi.org/members/AR6346HB\">sponsors</a>, but they&rsquo;re <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/openstack/\">big on open source</a>, and their London data centre runs on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rackspace.co.uk/green-hosting\">100% renewable energy</a>, all of which make us happy.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there wasn&rsquo;t anything around that we could use as a storage appliance backed by Rackspace Cloudfiles, which was a problem. Then, we realised - using a little bit of code and some cheap hardware, we could make our own!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://theodi.github.io/presentations/philbot/philbot.jpg\" alt=\"Philbot\" /></p>\n\n<p>So, this is Philbot. It&rsquo;s pretty simple, hardware wise. It&rsquo;s a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\">Raspberry Pi</a> with a 2TB Seagate USB hard disk attached, which it shares over the network using the usual network drive protocols. All in all, under a \u00a3100. Not bad.</p>\n\n<p>The magic is in the software. We&rsquo;re a Ruby shop mostly, and there are some amazing open source gems out there that let us do most of this really easily.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, our code uses the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/guard/listen\">Listen</a> gem to watch the filesystem and detect when things change. The idea is that when <em>real</em> Phil saves a file onto Philbot&rsquo;s disk, the script will notice. If a file is added, modified, or deleted, then it&rsquo;s placed onto a queue (using <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/resque/resque\">Resque</a>). That queue is processed in the background, and the file is uploaded or removed from Cloudfiles as appropriate using the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/fog/fog\">fog</a> gem. All in all, it&rsquo;s really very little code, mostly just glue to connect together the parts. It&rsquo;s all test driven with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber\">Cucumber</a> as well, another of our favourite tools.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, it works. Human Phil can save files on a large network drive, and they will be instantly backed up to Cloudfiles. If he deletes them, they will be removed from Cloudfiles as well. In future, we want to add a function to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; directories, which removes them from the local storage but leaves them in the cloud for long-term cold storage. </p>\n\n<p>There are some other future plans; we want to make the configuration of the device itself operate using a network drive with a configuration file on it, and then create a Raspberry Pi OS image with it all preconfigured, so that you can just plug it in and get going. That&rsquo;s in the future though; for now it&rsquo;s handling our day to day needs nicely.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you would like to have your own cloud storage appliance for less than a hundred quid, why not take a look at the detailed setup instructions in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/philbot/\">Philbot repository on GitHub</a>.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, ODI CEO Gavin Starks and FivebyFive\u2019s Kat Borlongan all spoke at the conference about the potential for open data, and the importance of openness and transparency.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, ODI CEO said</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Open data in France has taken a huge leap forward this week. Today\u2019s Presidential event with ODI Paris and Snips, and the fact that France has joined the OGP, show that the French government is acting to catalyse the huge business opportunities that open data can bring; to drive open innovation and better services for French citizens.

By operating across different countries, it can unlock the best supplies of data, generate demand and enhance our knowledge of its potential to address common issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Kat Borlongan, co-founder of FivebyFive said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It&rsquo;s almost shocking how many complex problems open data can solve. It&rsquo;s a big step forward for FivebyFive, as a young startup, to be invited to sit down with the President over lunch and not just tell him but show him what we mean. It sends a strong signal to the open data community as a whole and makes us even more hopeful for the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rand Hindi from Snips said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is a real honour to be invited to discuss such important topics with the French President. As a startup specialising in modelling how people and cities interact, we rely heavily on open data to build contextual models of urban environments. We can already predict passenger flow in public transport, car accidents and crime. The more data we can access, the more problems we can solve, thus contributing to making cities a better place to live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"News: French President talks open data with ODI Paris and ODI Supporter, Snips, at exclusive honorary lunch","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/publishing-open-statistical-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/publishing-open-statistical-data","slug":"publishing-open-statistical-data","title":"Publishing Open Statistical Data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:39:01+01:00","created_at":"2014-04-24T10:55:18+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/5f/b8/535fb821f362be26d8000001/observation.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"attachment-535fb820d0d4620816000007\" /></p>\n\n<p>At <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://digitalpublishing.ons.gov.uk/2014/04/01/fresh-thinking-ons-and-the-odi/\">the request of the ONS</a>, the ODI tech team have recently been exploring some ideas around publishing statistical open data. This blog post shares some of the results of that thinking and you can also explore <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://open-statistics.herokuapp.com/\">a proof-of-concept</a> that showcases some of these ideas with real-world data.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, there are plenty of existing best practices for data publication that should be followed regardless of the type of data being published: clear licensing, availability of bulk downloads, use \nof standard, open formats, are all important. The guidance in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificate</a> questionnaire applies to all types of data, including statistics.</p>\n\n<p>But arguably there are some specific challenges that apply to the publication and re-use of statistical data. These challenges are partly due to the inherent complexity of (even simple) statistical publications. Communicating this context effectively is incredibly important in understanding and properly interpreting this type of data.</p>\n\n<p>The wide community of re-users of statistical data, each have their own distinct needs, also presents challenges: politicians, policy makers, journalists, application developers and members of the general public all need to access to official statistics at various times and in different ways.</p>\n\n<p>It is vital that statistical data is published in a way that makes it easy to locate, easy to understand, and easy to use. Statistical data needs to be immediately accessible to all users and this is as much about good user experience design as it is about ready access to bulk downloads and APIs.</p>\n\n<p>There are four key elements to what the team have been exploring so far.</p>\n\n<h2>Documentation is Vital</h2>\n\n<p>Documentation is a vital part of a statistical data release. Many statistical organisations publish analysis alongside their raw data. It is this analysis that starts to tell the initial stories around the data, drawing out the key highlights.</p>\n\n<p>But at a deeper level all aspects of the dataset need to be documented, and this information needs to be readily available in both human and machine-readable forms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What are the dimensions of the dataset? If the dimension is based on a code list or controlled vocabulary then what do the individual values mean and how do they relate to one another?</li>\n  <li>What is actually being measured?</li>\n  <li>What contextual information is required to understand individual values? For example are the numbers provisional, or are they based on limited coverage?</li>\n  <li>Is this the latest data available? When was it published? Has it been revised?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unfortunately it can often be difficult to answer these questions. Even when the raw data is available, the context required to properly interpret the data is not readily available.</p>\n\n<p>Statistical data, more than any other form of government open data, is prone to being published in carefully formatted Excel spreadsheets. The formatting is usually unnecessary, but often its there to communicate some additional context. Provisional values may be in italics. Letter codes might be added to individual data points, referencing footnotes that provide some important notes on interpreting the value. </p>\n\n<p>When we publish data to the web we can do better: We can link directly to the necessary context, in both the human and machine-readable views of the data.</p>\n\n<h2>Link All The Things</h2>\n\n<p>Every aspect of a statistical dataset should be part of the web: the dataset, its structural elements (dimensions, attributes and measures), and every individual observation should each have a unique URL.</p>\n\n<p>If observations have their own URLs then users can link to individual data points. This allows analysis to be directly linked to its supporting evidence. </p>\n\n<p>Dynamic URLs can be used to redirect to the latest figures, ensuring that people are always accessing the latest data. But the archive of individual observations can still be navigated by linking together observations collected in the previous month, quarter, or year. </p>\n\n<p>If all of the structural elements of a dataset have unique identifiers, then the definitions of terms become accessible from a single click, rather than searching through supporting notes and documentation.</p>\n\n<h2>Slicing and Dicing</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/5f/b8/535fb886f362be26d8000003/slice.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"attachment-535fb8861f986a0b6a000034\" /></p>\n\n<p>There are many differents ways to slice through a statistical dataset. Comparisons can be made across different dimensions to create time-series and other charts. Rather than create a few fixed presentations, e.g. individual data tables or static charts, the data should be published via an API that supports dynamically slicing the data. This facilitates the creation of more dynamic presentations of the data: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Developers can use the API to extract the collection of data points they need, rather than downloading a\n whole dataset</li>\n  <li>Users can navigate through a dataset to generate simple visualisations, e.g. time series of some area of interest</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This can also simplify the production processes that support the creation of statistical releases allowing analysts to dynamically generate whatever charts and tables are required.</p>\n\n<h2>Embeddable Views</h2>\n\n<p>Dynamic views of the data should not be confined to the original website. The charts and data tables produced for end-users should be embeddable in other websites, allowing them to be included in news reports, blog posts, etc.</p>\n\n<p>This greatly simplifies the process of data re-use for many users. Seamless sharing of information, via linking, is an important part of how discussion happens on the web today. Embeddedable views also help address questions of provenance and trust by allowing readers to easily locate the original data sources referenced in an article. </p>\n\n<p>Taken together we think these four elements will usefully complement publication of raw open data; help to integrate statistical data into the web; and make it easier for all types of user to make the most from statistical publications.</p>\n\n<p>Visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://open-statistics.herokuapp.com/\">proof-of-concept application</a> to explore how some of these ideas work in the context of the Producer Price Index dataset and for more background on how we built the application.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","web_url":"http://theodi.org/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","web_url":"http://theodi.org/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/talking-about-a-data-revolution-livestream.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/talking-about-a-data-revolution-livestream","slug":"talking-about-a-data-revolution-livestream","title":"Talking About a Data Revolution: Gavin Starks panel video catch up","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:38:59+01:00","created_at":"2014-04-15T15:40:31+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"The data revolution is underway\u2014offering policymakers, businesses, and citizens unprecedented new opportunities to make informed decisions for better lives.

Even if they are aware of this they likely don\u2019t know how to best publish and release the data in a way which is useful to others.  </p>\n\n<p>During the session I talked about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mastodonc.com/\">Mastodon C</a>, a start-up company incubated at the ODI, which identified that <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21567980-how-scrutiny-freely-available-data-might-save-nhs-money-beggar-thy-neighbour\">\u00a3200m could be saved by the NHS each year</a>, on just one drug type (statins), simply by prescribing the non-branded versions. This was determined in just eight weeks by analysing open data, and is just one example of how open government data can be released and used responsibly to help a business grow and to show the government where it can save money.</p>\n\n<p>More and more data is being released as organisations recognise the value of doing this, but there is a way to go. </p>\n\n<p>Just one example: there are 260 million companies around the world all creating their own data about their emissions, material use etc. Imagine what could be achieved if they released their environmental data in a common machine readable format. Such data could both enable organisations to understand their own environmental impact and behaviour, and help us to see trends and collective impacts and behaviours across organisations and businesses.</p>\n\n<p>What makes this challenging, however, is the absence of a universal framework or format for environmental data, or indeed legislation to encourage companies to open up access to this kind of data. Reporting schemes like the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Pages/HomePage.aspx\">Carbon Disclosure Project </a> help - legislation about how, when and in what format industry should make data available would go a lot further.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The skills needed to supply, disseminate and mine the data are in short supply</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many people get excited about big data and the patterns they see in it, but can\u2019t or don\u2019t have the experience to do more with it. A recent <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/21a6e7d8-b479-11e3-a09a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2yqc1UgxG\">article</a> in the Financial Times goes into this in more detail and is worth a read: it summarises that it is imperative to combine big data technical and scientific skills with domain expertise else risk missing the real truth in the data.</p>\n\n<p>The same can be seen across organisations where the skills needed to handle, use and release data can vary dramatically. A straw poll at one of the tables I joined showed that only a handful of the businesses present had dedicated data teams.</p>\n\n<p>Developing and increasing data skills in businesses will help to plug this gap.</p>\n\n<p>The Royal Statistical Society recently launched<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentChapterView.asp?chapter=25\"> Get Stats</a>, a new programme to enable and encourage the responsible use of numbers. I\u2019d highly recommend it for anyone looking for the basics in how to use numbers. And the ODI has a training arm delivering both<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/courses\"> introductory and more advanced courses</a> on open data, and free <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures\">lunchtime lectures</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Different data formats are needed for different audiences and different use cases</strong></p>\n\n<p>Complex data sets will work for some people but, where there is a wider need (or even greater good) to communicate, different formats can be deployed to help people to understand and use data.</p>\n\n<p>For example, mainstream audiences may find data visualisations / infographics easier to engage with. This<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/when-sea-levels-attack-2/\"> visualisation</a> of the impact of rising sea levels on world cities is a good example of how data can be turned into interesting and understandable content.</p>\n\n<p>Engaging the public in gathering data \u2013 crowdsourcing \u2013 can also be a powerful tool, not only helping to get them interested and involved but also generating new data and insights not available within businesses. Cancer Research has just launched a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-02/04/genes-in-space-cancer-research\">campaign</a> to do this.</p>\n\n<p>The session wrapped up with a few final thoughts. I\u2019ll leave one of them with you: The original renaissance took around 300 years, can we afford for the data renaissance to take that long?</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"ODI blog post: Stuart Coleman","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Stuart Coleman","slug":"stuart-coleman","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-coleman","tag_ids":["executive","commercial","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Stuart Coleman","slug":"stuart-coleman","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-coleman","tag_ids":["executive","commercial","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/koreas-bright-open-data-future.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/koreas-bright-open-data-future","slug":"koreas-bright-open-data-future","title":"Korea's bright open data future","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:38:58+01:00","created_at":"2014-04-15T11:40:23+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014","slug":"odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014","title":"Node knowledge - Feb 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:38:47+01:00","created_at":"2014-02-22T21:35:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/node-knowledge-november-2013.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/node-knowledge-november-2013","slug":"node-knowledge-november-2013","title":"Node Knowledge\u2026 November 2013","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:38:43+01:00","created_at":"2013-11-18T17:58:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/about-nodes.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/about-nodes","slug":"about-nodes","title":"Nodes","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:38:08+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-23T12:22:16+01:00","tag_ids":["page"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"What an energising (if somewhat last minute!), insightful and hugely enjoyable visit to Seoul and www2014.

What has followed is the most senior of government and agency support from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_House\">\u2018blue house\u2019</a> and President Park Geun-hye, implementation leadership and support from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://eng.nia.or.kr/english/eng_nia.asp\">Korean NIA </a>and a community of open data activists both inside and out of government.

Drawing parallels to the UK\u2019s own Government digital services mission, the Korean administration recognizes the huge opportunity digital government has to transform citizens experience of, access to, and interaction with government. Both programmes enlist open data at their core and the NIA is clearly iterating their open data strategy and data releases in line with the demands and needs of both citizens and businesses. </p>\n\n<p>A huge thank you to our local ODI node <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.saltlux.com/\">Saltlux</a> and to representatives from the Korean NIA.

While CSV is a very simple format, it is surprisingly easy to create files that are hard for others to use. </p>\n\n<p>The tool we&rsquo;ve created is called <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/\">CSVLint</a> and this blog post provides some background on why we&rsquo;ve built the tool, its key features, and why we think it can help improve the quality of a large amount of open data.</p>\n\n<h2>Why build a CSV validator?</h2>\n\n<p>Jeni Tennison recently described 2014 as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/2014-the-year-of-csv\">the Year of CSV</a>. A lot, perhaps even the majority, of Open Data is published in the tabular format CSV. CSV has many short-comings, but is very widely supported and can be easy to use.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately though, lots of CSV data is published in broken and inconsistent ways. There are numerous reasons why this happens, but two of the key issues are that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>tools differ in how they produce or expect to consume CSV data, leading to the creation of many different variants or &ldquo;dialects&rdquo; of CSV that have different delimiters, escape characters, encoding, etc</li>\n  <li>lots of data is dumped from spreadsheets that are designed for human-reading and not automated processing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This case study on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/the-status-of-csvs-on-datagovuk\">the status of CSVs on data.gov.uk</a> highlights the size of this issue: only a third of the data was machine-readable.</p>\n\n<p>These types of issues can be addressed by better tooling. Validation tools can help guide data publishers towards best practices providing them with a means to check data before it is published to ensure it is usable. Validation tools can also help re-users check data before it is consumed and provide useful feedback to publishers on issues.</p>\n\n<p>This is the motivation behind CSVLint.</p>\n\n<h2>Gathering Requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To ensure that we were building a tool that would meet the needs of a variety of users, we gathered requirements from several sources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A <strong>user workshop</strong> &ndash; we engaged with a group of data publishers and re-users to discuss the issues they faced and the features they would like to see. The attendees identified and prioritised a potential set of features for the tool</li>\n  <li><strong>background research</strong> &ndash; we <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csv-validation-research\">explored</a> a range of different tools, techniques and formats for validating and describing CSV files. This allowed us to identify the types of validation that might be useful and ways to describe constraints and create schemas</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We used this input to refine an initial set of features which formed the backlog for the project. The key things that we needed to deliver were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a CSV syntax validator to check that the basic structure of a CSV file</li>\n  <li>an extended validator that could check a CSV file against a schema, e.g. to ensure that it contained the correct columns with the correct data types</li>\n  <li>a way to generate documentation for schemas, to make it easy for people to publish and aggregate data in common formats</li>\n  <li>a tool that can be used to check data both before and after publication</li>\n  <li>clear guidance on how to fix identified problems</li>\n  <li>integration options for embedding these tools into other various workflows</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The CSVLint Alpha</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4d/22/534d22121f986a2ef0000182/csvlint-home.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"attachment-534d2212d0d4623a4a000003\" /></p>\n\n<p>The end result of our efforts is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/\">CSVLint</a> an open service that supports the validation of CSV files published in a variety of ways. </p>\n\n<p>The service is made up of two components. The web application provides all of the user facing functionality, including the reporting, etc. It is backed by an underlying software library, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csvlint.rb\">csvlint.rb</a>, that does all of the heavy lifting around data validation. </p>\n\n<p>Both <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csvlint\">the web application</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csvlint.rb\">the library</a> are open source. This means that everything we&rsquo;ve built is available for others to customise, improve, or re-deploy.</p>\n\n<p>The service builds on some existing work by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, including the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/csv-dialect/\">CSV dialect</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/\">JSON Table Schema</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/\">Data Package</a> formats.</p>\n\n<p>CSVLint supports validating CSV data that has been published in a variety of different ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>As a single CSV file available from a public URL</li>\n  <li>As a collection of CSV files packaged into a zip file</li>\n  <li>As a collection of CSV files associated with a CKAN package</li>\n  <li>As a Data Package</li>\n  <li>Via uploading individual files</li>\n  <li>Via uploading a zip file</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Data uploaded to the tool is deemed to be &ldquo;pre-publication&rdquo; so the validation reports are not logged. This allows publishers to validate and improve their data files before making them public. </p>\n\n<p>All other data is deemed to be public and validation reports are added to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/validation\">the list of recent validations</a>. This provides a feedback loop to help highlight common errors.</p>\n\n<h2>Validation Reports</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4d/21/534d21a1f362be6c87000152/csvlint.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"attachment-534d21a1d0d4623a4a000002\" /></p>\n\n<p>The validation reports (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/validation/5343d38a6373760715770000\">example</a>) have been designed to give &ldquo;at a glance&rdquo; feedback on the results, as well as a detailed breakdown of each issue.</p>\n\n<p>All feedback is classified along two different dimensions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Type of feedback\n    <ul>\n      <li>Error &ndash; problems that needs to be fixed for the CSV to be considered valid</li>\n      <li>Warning &ndash; problems that should be fixed, but aren&rsquo;t critical</li>\n      <li>Message &ndash; additional feedback on areas for improvement or assumptions made during the validation</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Category of error\n    <ul>\n      <li>Structure &ndash; problems with the syntax of the file, e.g. problems with quoting or delimiters</li>\n      <li>Schema &ndash; issues caused by schema validation failures</li>\n      <li>Context &ndash; problems related to how the data has been published, e.g. the <code>Content-Type</code> used to serve the file</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The summary table for each validation result is supplemented with detailed feedback on every reported issue with suggested improvements.</p>\n\n<p>The report also includes badges that allow a summary result and a link to a full report to be embedded in other web applications. </p>\n\n<p>A <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/validation/5343d38a6373760715770000.json\">JSON view</a> of a validation result provides other integration options.</p>\n\n<h2>Schema Validation</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to checking structural problems with CSV files, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/\">CSVLint</a> service can also validate a file against a schema.</p>\n\n<p>We proposed some suggested improvements to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema\">JSON Table Schema</a> format that would allow <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/#field-constraints\">constraints</a> to be expressed for individual fields in a table, e.g. minimum length, patterns, etc. These have now been incorporated into the latest version of the specification.</p>\n\n<p>CSVLint currently supports schemas based on the latest version of JSON Table Schema. There is some background <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/about\">in the documentation</a> (see &ldquo;How To Write a Schema&rdquo;) and it is possible to see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/schemas\">a list of recently used schemas</a> to view further examples.</p>\n\n<p>Using a schema it is possible to perform additional checks, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>whether the columns have the right name</li>\n  <li>required fields are populated</li>\n  <li>fields have a minimum or maximum length, or match a pattern</li>\n  <li>field values are unique</li>\n  <li>values match a declared type, e.g. a date</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This provides a lot of flexibility for checking the data contained in a CSV file. When validating a file a user may specify a schema file to be used when validating the data, either uploading it with the data or pointing to an existing schema that has been published to the web. For <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/\">Data Packages</a> any built-in schema is automatically applied. Schemas can be uploaded along with a data file or published openly on the web.</p>\n\n<p>CSVLint automatically generates some summary documentation for schemas loaded from the web, e.g. this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/schemas/530b16c163737676e9260000\">schema for the Land Registry Price Paid data</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>How CSVLint can make a difference</h2>\n\n<p>While CSLint is still an alpha release there are already a rich set of features available to support guiding and improving data publication. We think that the service can potentially play a number of roles:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>by helping users of all kinds improve the data they are publishing via a quick feedback loop that will guide them on fixing errors</li>\n  <li>enabling communities to publish schemas that describe and validate data formats to simplify the aggregation of open data</li>\n  <li>supporting data re-users in checking source data to catch common problems and provide useful constructive feedback to data publishers</li>\n  <li>allowing data repositories to use CSVLint badges in their service to provide immediate feedback to both publishers and re-users on data quality</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But to prove this we need people to start using the tool. User feedback will provide us with useful guidance on how the service might evolve. So we&rsquo;re really keen to get feedback on how well CSVLint supports your particular data publication or re-use use case. </p>\n\n<p>Please try out the service and share your experience by leaving a comment on this blog post.

I still remember how shattered my nerves were prior to the first <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/courses/open-data-practice\">Open Data in Practice</a> course in April 2012. The first day certainly wasn\u2019t my best performance, but the feedback at the end of the week was amazing and set the pace for our training moving forward.</p>\n\n<p>Our first year of training has seen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>51 days of training and counting&hellip;</li>\n  <li>356 people trained from more than 10 countries</li>\n  <li>Lots and lots of tea and coffee drunk (we lost count)</li>\n  <li>Over 1,000 pieces of Sushi eaten (only served on our Open Data in Practice course, so far)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And this year? We have just launched two new courses: the 5-day <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/courses/applying-linked-open-data\">Open Data Technologies</a> course and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/courses/finding-stories-in-open-data\">Finding Stories in Open Data</a> taught by our statistician <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/team/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich Atz</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Launching the Open Data Technologies course represents the maturity of the open data movement and the readiness of people to move to a phase two rollout of open data. The aim is that this will lead to open data as a whole becoming more usable, more discoverable and much better supported. Such improvements will not only bring about greater transparency, but realise the true benefits that open data can bring to every citizen.</p>\n\n<h3>Discoveries along the way</h3>\n<p>We have certainly had fun in our first year and made some interesting discoveries:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://kode1100.com/ODI-training/\">Corruption is not correlated to government aid funding</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/280059/2012.pdf\">On 21 Jan 2012, an RAF search and rescue helicopter flew the length of the UK during one rescue mission</a> (PDF) </li>\n  <li>We have still to find the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=unicorn%20dataset&amp;defid=7707933\">Unicorn Dataset</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Training is an essential part of the ODI, so as well new courses we shall be aiming to increase the number of open data trainers by rolling our trainer accreditation over the next year.

This year, more than 90 partnerships entered across the 8 award categories.</p>\n\n<p>The partnership has been recognised as one of the top five within the A&amp;B New Sponsorship Award category for the innovative use of the arts to reinforce the branding and marketing activity of the business. It demonstrates how new collaborations between the arts and business sectors continue to drive exciting arts initiatives throughout the UK.</p>\n\n<p>In 2012, as a brand new organisation with no prior engagement with the arts, the ODI sponsored the female-focused organisation MzTEK to become a partner in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/culture\">Data as Culture</a> programme. MzTEK not only had access to artists working in the field of new media, computer arts and technology but could also ensure a balanced demographic was reached in the commissioning process. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Sophie McDonald</strong>, MzTEK and co-curator of the first Data as Culture exhibition, said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeing a partner in the Data as Culture programme was an exciting opportunity for MzTEK to expand our curatorial practice, reach new audiences and support female data artists to apply for the data-driven art commissions, an area which is predominantly a male domain.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Julie Freeman</strong>, Open Data Institute Art Associate and co-curator of Data as Culture said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe impact of the Data as Culture art programme has been significant not only to the ODI community but in the wider context of the arts. Our programme is becoming a key player in the creation and promotion of data art.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks</strong>, Open Data Institute CEO said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cData as Culture is for everyone. We want to ensure conversations about open data expand beyond specialist communities and through to the general public. Using data as a material increases awareness of what data is, how it can be used creatively, how it can inspire, encourage play and lateral thinking, and help people share stories and experiences. It has touched everyone who has visited the ODI, our team, and reached an international audience via global media channels.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As Chair of the New Sponsorship judging panel and Head of Marketing at Barclays, <strong>Jane Powell</strong> states of the shortlisted partnerships: \u201cI think a number of them can actually form a model for how businesses and arts organisations can work really well together and in very imaginative ways as well.\u201d</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"ODI and MzTEK shortlisted for 35th Arts & Business Awards ","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/an-answer-in-pakistan-to-what-is-open-data-for.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/an-answer-in-pakistan-to-what-is-open-data-for","slug":"an-answer-in-pakistan-to-what-is-open-data-for","title":"Member blog: An answer in Pakistan to \u2018what is open data for?\u2019","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:38:57+01:00","created_at":"2014-04-02T16:37:56+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"The Millennium Development Goals, agreed at the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, have as their second objective that \u2013 by 2015 \u2013 all children will have universal access to primary education.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, some 100 million children globally were not in school.

We&rsquo;re a year away from the target.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistan, by all accounts, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/687360/pakistan-education-atlas-2013-education-survey-reveals-mixed-bag-of-results/\">has failed to achieve the goal.</a></p>\n\n<p>A <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/pdf/EDUCATION_IN_PAKISTAN__A_FACT_SHEET.pdf\">UNESCO fact-sheet</a> presents the problem. 1 in 12 of out-of-school children, 5.1 million, live in Pakistan. Literacy rates in Pakistan are stagnant at 58% of the population, with only 50% of the rural population ever attending school. Two-thirds of those out-of-school are girls. Primary net enrolment has risen from 58% to 74%, but this hides tremendous variation. Only 17% of people have ever been to school in Punjab while 37% have attended in Balochistan.</p>\n\n<p>And even these statistics hide tremendous variation in reporting. Some estimates put out-of-school children at 10 million in Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, then, a concerted effort is required to ensure that the best approaches to improving education outcomes are recognised and used to improve results elsewhere in Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.alifailaan.pk/\">Alif Ailaan</a>, an education research and advocacy organisation in Pakistan, has been working with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.htspe.com/\">HTSPE</a>, an international social and economic development consultancy, and funded by DFID, to build a convincing set of case studies and research to drive education improvement.</p>\n\n<p>One way they have begun to do this is to open up research studies looking at Pakistan&rsquo;s education system and present that in a user-friendly fashion. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dillinger.io/index.php/case-studies/9-case-studies-education-outcomes-transparency-from-research-data-in-pakistan\">Whythawk has </a>been supporting the project. Our work includes building <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-basiccharts\">extensions to the CKAN</a> open data publishing platform to allow <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dashboard\">data-driven dashboards</a> for online advocacy. I&rsquo;ve just returned from a week in Islamabad with the enthusiastic professionals driving the Pakistan Education Portal training them on how to use the portal.</p>\n\n<p>Their drive is clear: work with existing research institutes and programs to release their data so that other researchers can perform meta-studies, develop new and useful insight, and so drive meaningful change.</p>\n\n<p>It is a useful and timely answer to the question: why should I release my data?</p>\n\n<p>The term &ldquo;open data&rdquo; has become somewhat loaded, but \u2013 to simplify \u2013 means that data are accessible without limitation in some standardised and machine-readable form.</p>\n\n<p>Organisations which intend to aggregate, reflect, and present analysis on published data from different sources should not be confronted with a tsunami of licence conditions in order to do so. National statistical data which demands that &ldquo;An electronic copy of all reports and publications based on the requested data will be sent to the National Data Archive,&rdquo; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pages/terms\">for instance</a>, places a massive burden on future users of that data.</p>\n\n<p>It must be recognised, though, that releasing and maintaining such data is a perpetual and costly business. Many national governments have signed up, but implementation lags.</p>\n\n<p>Tim Berners-Lee has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.digital.telefonica.com/2013/10/09/tim-berners-lee-telefonica-open-agenda/\">spoken eloquently</a> <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/09/raw-data\">about the benefits</a> of &ldquo;raw data&rdquo; and why governments should release it. &ldquo;The information about spending, agriculture, health and education that lies behind locked databases could be used to dramatically improve people&rsquo;s lives. When governments begin to release data openly on the web, the growing movement of hackers and activists and even internal government agencies and corporations, can begin to use the previously unconnected and undissected numbers, images and graphs to create new ways for you to access valuable new information.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>While there are stories of open data being used, far too many are mundane. Many, such as maps to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://findtoilet.dk/\">nearest toilet</a>, or where you can walk your dog, are hardly reasons for governments to pay attention. Numerous public and commercial services already provide such information.</p>\n\n<p>The few stories that are compelling, however, are very compelling.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.sarpam.net/\">The Southern African Regional Programme on Access to Medicines and Diagnostic</a>s, for example, used open access to medicine pricing to develop a regional study. They found some governments were being charged up to 25 times more for the same drugs. A <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/7192271.stm\">similar exercise in the UK</a> looking at which statins, a commonly-used cholesterol-lowering drug, were being prescribed by doctors, indicated that simply changing to generics could save the fiscus \u00a370 million a year, or enough to employ 2,000 nurses.</p>\n\n<p>And then there&rsquo;s our work at Whythawk, supporting the team at Alif Ailaan in Pakistan. I believe that, after their service goes live in June, and as their data are consolidated, new insights will drive better outcomes for youngsters there.</p>\n\n<p>These are big projects, and the world is still filled with major challenges which can only be resolved through institutional funding and major professional effort. Supporting farmers in rural African villages to adapt their crops for climate change. Improving healthcare outcomes. Education. Many of these are being driven by opportunities for open access research publication.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is also true that the open data industry will only reach maturity when thousands of enterprises are able to build profitable businesses from a reliable source of open access and public data.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, consulting services like Whythawk are part of that commercial impetus for open data. But neither is this a movement limited exclusively to the developed nations.</p>\n\n<p>Linet Kwamboka, a founder at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://datascience.co.ke/\">DataScience in Kenya</a>, is in the business of aggregating open data from various sources while creating relationships across sectors to mainly help businesses and investors understand where opportunities and great returns are. She explains the business advantage as, &ldquo;If as an investor you wanted to invest in flower farming in Kenya for example, do you do it in Nakuru county because that is where everyone is doing it or is there another county in Kenya that has more favourable climate, manpower and proximity for the activity? We help you make the right decision with lower risk.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This is a fantastic start and I wish her every success. Importantly, the more initiatives like this, along with the big global development initiatives, the better the case for open data becomes.</p>\n\n<p>Five years after Tim Berners-Lee got a roomful of people to chant <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web\">&ldquo;raw data now&rdquo; at TED</a>, we are finally building up good reasons why data owners should listen.</p>\n\n<p>Gavin Chait is Lead Consultant at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.whythawk.com/\">Whythawk</a>, an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/membership\">ODI supporter</a>.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"Member blog: An answer in Pakistan to \u2018what is open data for?\u2019","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Gavin Chait","slug":"gavin-chait","web_url":"http://theodi.org/gavin-chait","tag_ids":["members"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Gavin Chait","slug":"gavin-chait","web_url":"http://theodi.org/gavin-chait","tag_ids":["members"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-connect-march-2014-in-photographs.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-connect-march-2014-in-photographs","slug":"odi-connect-march-2014-in-photographs","title":"ODI Connect in photographs","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:38:51+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-31T11:39:13+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data","slug":"member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data","title":"Member blog: Creating fruitful partnerships with open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:37:40+01:00","created_at":"2013-09-10T10:52:18+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-welcomes-new-members.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-welcomes-new-members","slug":"odi-welcomes-new-members","title":"ODI Welcomes New Members","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-05-15T16:37:36+01:00","created_at":"2013-07-22T17:29:42+01:00","tag_ids":["news"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<iframe src=\"http://www.flickr.com/slideShow/index.gne?group_id=&amp;user_id=93591348@N03&amp;set_id=72157643205491853&amp;tags=Cars,Lotus,Exige\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"739\" height=\"493\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<p><br />\nOn March 26th we held the third ODI Connect networking evening at HM Treasury.

Using data as a material increases awareness of what data is, how it can be used creatively, how it can inspire, encourage play and lateral thinking, and help people share stories and experiences.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Works include James Bridle\u2019s <em>Watching the Watchers</em>, a series of prints showing military drone bases, exposing the all seeing eyes used by armies worldwide with the help of Google Earth. A banner by Sam Meech visualises working hours as knitting patterns and YoHa\u2019s fun and cynical <em>Invisible Airs</em> pneumatic contraptions respond to spending data from Bristol City Council, causing a spud gun to fire, a bicycle seat to rise up and down and a knife to stab a book - their financial reports. thickear collective will process personal data in their <em>Pink Sheet Method</em> performance taking place across three cities, while Paolo Cirio\u2019s self-reflecting exhibition catalogue exposes visitor\u2019s digital fingerprints as they look at the work.</p>\n\n<p>Gavin Starks, ODI CEO, said, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cThe Data as Culture programme challenges us to question the role of data in society. For example, the tools of surveillance are available to many - as illustrated in James Bridle work showing \u201csecret\u201d drones visible using public satellite maps. The comedic open data book stabber reflects how truly tedious and mundane data gathering and processing is. We want to ensure conversations about open data expand beyond specialist communities and through to the general public.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shiri Shalmy, commissioned curator, said, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cThe exhibition presents a wide range of creative approaches to the use of data, intentionally moving away from screen-based representations of information and instead experimenting with the possibilities of manifesting data in physical form. While in some cases visitors are asked to simply join the dots, in others they must respond to the artist\u2019s call: give us your data!\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The exhibition will be open to members of the public during office hours, Monday to Friday. Visitors are advised to ring ahead if possible on 020 3598 9395, or email <a href=\"&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#111;&#100;&#105;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;\">&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#111;&#100;&#105;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To broaden the reach of the exhibition, the ODI has partnered with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/\">Lighthouse</a>, a digital culture agency and gallery in Brighton, and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://futureeverything.org/\">FutureEverything</a>, based in Manchester, who are critically engaged in technology, and run one of the longest standing media arts festivals in the world.

A total of seven challenges will run across the programme and are open to all.</p>\n\n<p>Each finalist in the education strand created a product or a service which uses open data to enable parents to make more informed choices about their child\u2019s education, either by helping them express a preference for a school, choose a subject or other learning priorities or engage with their children\u2019s learning.</p>\n\n<p>The three finalists are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Illustreets - a location research tool for England to help parents in choosing schools that are the \u201cbest-fit\u201d for their children rather than just the \u201cbest schools\u201d.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>In context \u2013 Brenda: a tool that allows a university admissions officer or recruiter to contextualise social background and education achievements of an applicant.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Skills Route - a service that will calculate which schools, colleges or apprenticeship providers are right for a person, based on your location, subject preferences and likely GCSE attainment.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Jeni Tennison, Open Data Challenge Series judge and ODI Technical Director, said: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We had an impressive group of teams at the Education Open Data Challenge Creation Weekend with a variety of uses of open data.

They will now be supported by the ODI and Nesta who will give them access to relevant expertise and mentoring to develop their projects. Throughout the next phase of development, they will assess the impact of their projects. \nThe finalists were selected at a hack style event (Creation Weekend) that enabled participants to test their products and pitch their ideas to the judging panel.

Data sharing might be with the individuals that the data is about (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/personal-data\">midata</a>), within government, or outside government such as to researchers, charities or commercial companies. Examples that we have seen proposed by government are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.education.gov.uk/consultations/index.cfm?action=conResults&amp;consultationId=1854\">the Department for Education providing more access to the National Pupil Database to data analytics companies</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/sharing-and-publishing-data-for-public-benefit\">HMRC providing the full VAT register only to credit reference agencies</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/records/healthrecords/Pages/care-data.aspx\">NHS England providing pseudonymised health data to pharmaceutical firms</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Open data is providing unrestricted data to everyone.</strong> By definition, open data must be available to all without restrictions on what they do with it. And the corollary of that is there cannot be any legal restrictions on making that data available. For example personal data can only be open data if it is written in law that it must be published (for example, insolvency notices in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.thegazette.co.uk/\">London Gazette</a>) or if the affected individuals have given their permission for that publication.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>More data is always more useful (if you know what to do with it).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are lots of companies, charities and individuals who would benefit if all the data the public sector holds was shared with them, particularly if it was shared <em>only</em> with them. Those benefits have to be balanced against the rights of individuals to have their data protected by government and the risks to individuals and to society of too much data being available (for example, through making fraud easier).</p>\n\n<p>We believe that releasing open data is the right way of achieving that balance. It can satisfy a lot of the demand for data. It ensures a level playing field because everyone receives the same information. And it limits the release of personal data.</p>\n\n<p>When data sharing arrangements are put in place, we recommend using open data to minimise the number of restricted data releases that are made, to make the process transparent, and to ensure that everyone benefits from it. Namely:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Release open data.</strong> Provide aggregate and anonymised information that satisfies the majority of the demands that organisations have for data.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Document the data and the process to access it.</strong> It should be clear what the data holds, and the robust process that those who get hold of it have to go through to be granted access. See the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-pupil-database\">information on the National Pupil Database</a> as a good example.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Publish all requests for access as open data.</strong> The public has a right to know who is asking for, and being granted access, to their data and for what purpose.

The company estimated that a delay of 53 days, caused by a tendering process that is 45% slower than the EU averages, delays \u00a3734m of cash flow to UK SMEs each year.

We are providing concrete, practical help for procurement officers and contract managers, through the guides and training that we are putting together, to deploy open data to enhance transparency, improve efficiency and drive innovation. We are working with a number of private sector companies who are already seeing the benefits of opening up data.

Although there are<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/data-definitions\"> important differences between the three &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of data</a>, there is also a rich ecosystem of ideas, innovation and ultimately\nsocial and commercial opportunity emerging in the spaces where they overlap.</p>\n\n<p>But how do businesses make returns with open data? The answer begins by mining it! Consider Climate Corporation\u2019s massive disruption of the US farming insurance market and subsequent \u00a31bn exit at the end of last year. Its business began with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://e-pluribusunum.com/2013/10/03/digging-in-the-open-data-dirt-climate-corporation-finds-nearly-1-billion-in-acquisition/\">\u2018digging about in open data dirt\u2019</a> and convened the smartest Silicon Valley data scientists (co-incidentally exploiting the same <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://wit.io/posts/clojure-all-grown-up\">clojure</a> tech stack as our very own <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mastodonc.com/\">Mastodon C</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Surely other parts of the insurance industry are ripe for similar transformation? I would love to see open environmental, social and economic data combine with telematics data to help sort out the stale <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2012/oct/05/wheels-come-off-car-insurance-premiums-going-up\">mess</a> that UK car insurance premiums are in.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a space where personal data privacy could be really be debated. Imagine a dynamic monthly insurance premium fluctuating in line with risks assessed using open data sources and personal driving data - <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://telematicsnews.info/2013/03/04/41423_m4043/\">Citroen</a> is already looking at this. So open data is there to be used, for social, environmental and economic gains.</p>\n\n<p>The business case for publishing open data is gathering momentum. For example, our June 2013 research <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/\">Show me the money</a> (carried out in collaboration with the Bank of England) brought to the fore (and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8a03efee-ed3a-11e2-ad6e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2rih0H4Ta\">\nfront page of the FT</a>) a showcase example. Using anonymous aggregate customer data\nsourced from the three largest UK peer-to-peer lending businesses, we proved a healthy market has been developing throughout the downturn, serving the needs of consumers and small businesses at a time when traditional lenders are not.  </p>\n\n<p>For those businesses leading new financial services, open data offers a credible and highly defensible path to <em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2298979\">&lsquo;data intensive but prescriptively light&rsquo;</a></em> regulation, providing consumers and investors with a deeper level of transparency and an opportunity to invest with greater confidence. Open data applied more broadly in finance has huge potential to help businesses keep nimble, honest and highly competitive. Let\u2019s hope that 2014 sees the growth of more open finance and raises the transparency bar.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/\">\nShow me the Money</a> is an example of how greater openness might deliver competitive advantage in one sector but there are multiple reasons why for profit businesses can and should publish open data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Openly outsourcing research and development: a unique, fast and inexpensive way to get your hands on expert outside help.<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kaggle.com/\"> Kaggle</a> is using this approach in data science to investigate information challenges and opportunities. Look to reward and engage people for finding opportunities and errors. (Not everyone has a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/microsoft-rewards-100000-to-hacker-for-internet-explorer-bug-issues-update-429743\">$100,000</a> prize fund like Microsoft, but incentives work on a smaller scale too!).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open data procurement: as Nike opened up their supply chain data, their reputation improved and suppliers became more competitive on price and quality. In the same way that governments open data, businesses could open up their spending data. There would be no need to name the suppliers but the market could use the data freely to compete.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open data product data: publishing product information as open data can help to extend and better syndicate the reach of products and services making it easier for partners and customers to embed, link to and curate company data.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open data reputation: publishing frequent and relevant data on a company\u2019s business activities helps to prove it is serious about being a better citizen.  </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>2014 will be a year when more big businesses embrace openness. The question they will need to address is not whether they should publish open data but how and when. I look forward to helping them find the answers!</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Stuart Coleman is Commercial Director of the ODI.
