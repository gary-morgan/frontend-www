Often data has been collected over many years as a matter of routine, to drive specific processes or sometimes just for the sake of it. Suddenly that data is repurposed. It is probed, analysed and visualised in ways that haven\u2019t been tried before. Data analysts have a maxim: If you don\u2019t think you have a quality problem with your data, you haven\u2019t looked at it yet. Every dataset has its quirks, whether it\u2019s data that has been wrongly entered in the first place, automated processing that has introduced errors, irregularities that come from combining datasets into a consistent structure or simply missing information. Anyone who works with data knows that far more time is needed to clean data into something that can be analysed, and to understand what to leave out, than in actually performing the analysis itself. They also know that analysis and visualisation of data will often reveal bugs that you simply can\u2019t see by staring at a spreadsheet. But for the people who have collected and maintained such data \u2014 or more frequently their managers, who don\u2019t work with the data directly \u2014 this realisation can be a bit of a shock. In our last ODI Board meeting, Sir Tim Berners-Lee suggested that the data curators need to go through was something like the five stages of grief described by the K\u00fcbler-Ross model . So here is an outline of what that looks like. Denial This can\u2019t be right: there\u2019s nothing wrong with our data! Your analysis/code/visualisation must be doing something wrong. At this stage data custodians can\u2019t believe what they are seeing. Maybe they have been using the data themselves but never run into issues with it because they were only using it in limiting ways. Maybe they had only ever been collecting the data, and not actually using it at all. Or maybe they had been viewing it in a form where the issues with data quality were never surfaced (it\u2019s hard to spot additional spaces, or even zeros, when you just look at a spreadsheet in Excel, for example). So the first reason that they reach for is that there must be something wrong with the analysis or code that seems to reveal issues with the data. There may follow a wild goose chase that tries to track down the non-existent bug. Take heart: this exercise is useful in that it can pinpoint the precise records that are causing the problems in the first place, which forces the curators to stop denying them. Anger Who is responsible for these errors? Why haven\u2019t they been spotted before? As the fact that there are errors in the data comes to be understood, the focus can come to rest on the people who collect and maintain the data. This is the phase that the maintainers of data dread (and can be a reason for resisting sharing the data in the first place), because they get blamed for the poor quality. This painful phase should eventually result in an evaluation of where errors occur \u2014 an evaluation that is incredibly useful, and should be documented and kept for the Acceptance phase of the process \u2014 and what might be done to prevent them in future. Sometimes that might result in better systems for data collection but more often than not it will be recognised that some of the errors are legacy issues or simply unavoidable without massively increasing the maintenance burden. Bargaining What about if we ignore these bits here? Can you tweak the visualisation to hide that? And so the focus switches again to the analysis and visualisations that reveal the problems in the data, this time with an acceptance that the errors are real, but a desire to hide the problems so that they\u2019re less noticeable. This phase puts the burden on the analysts who are trying to create views over the data. They may be asked to add some special cases, or tweak a few calculations. Areas of functionality may be dropped in their entirety or radically changed as a compromise is reached between utility of the analysis and low quality data to feed it. Depression This whole dataset is worthless. There\u2019s no point even trying to capture this data any more. As the number of exceptions and compromises grows, and a realisation sinks in that those compromises undermine the utility of the analysis or visualisation as a whole, a kind of despair sets in. The barriers to fixing the data or collecting it more effectively may seem insurmountable, and the data curators may feel like giving up trying. This phase can lead to a re-examination of the reasons for collecting and maintaining the data in the first place. Hopefully, this process can aid everyone in reasserting why the data is useful, regardless of some aspects that are lower quality than others. Acceptance We know there are some problems with the data. We\u2019ll document them for anyone who wants to use it, and describe the limitations of the analysis. In the final stage, all those involved recognise that there are some data quality problems, but that these do not render the data worthless. They will understand the limits of analyses and interpretations that they make based on the data, and they try to document them to avoid other people being misled. The benefits of the previous stages are also recognised. Denial led to double-checking the calculations behind the analyses, making them more reliable. Anger led to re-examination of how the data was collected and maintained, and documentation that helps everyone understand the limits of the data better. Bargaining forced analyses and visualisations to be focused and explicit about what they do and don\u2019t show. Depression helped everyone focus on the user needs from the data. Each stage makes for a better end product. Of course doing data analysis isn\u2019t actually like being diagnosed with a chronic illness or losing a loved one. There are things that you can do to remedy the situation. So I think we need to add a sixth stage to the five stages of data grief described above: Hope This could help us spot errors in the data and fix them! Providing visualisations and analysis provides people with a clearer view about what data has been captured and can make it easier to spot mistakes, such as outliers caused by using the wrong units when entering a value, or new categories created by spelling mistakes. When data gets used to make decisions by the people who capture the data, they have a strong motivation to get the data right. As Francis Irving outlined in his recent Friday Lunchtime Lecture at ODI, Burn the Digital Paper , these feedback loops can radically change how people think about data, and use computers within their organisations. Making data open for other people to look at provides lots more opportunities for people to spot errors. This can be terrifying \u2014 who wants people to know that they are running their organisation based on bad-quality data? \u2014 but those who have progressed through the five stages of data grief find hope in another developer maxim: Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. \u2014 Linus\u2019s Law, The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric Raymond The more people look at your data, the more likely they are to find the problems within it. The secret is to build in feedback mechanisms which allow those errors to be corrected, so that you can benefit from those eyes and increase your data quality to what you thought it was in the first place.","slug":"five-stages-of-data-grief","tag_ids":["blog","odi"],"format":"blog","created_at":"2013-12-03T09:46:35+00:00"}},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing","title":"Publisher's Guide to Open Data Licensing","details":{"description":"At its simplest, open data requires just two things: data and openness. There are lots of aspects to openness, but at its most fundamental, they key is how the data is licensed . Data that doesn\u2019t explicitly have an open licence is not open data. But what does it mean to license data? What licence should you use? How can you indicate the licence that a dataset is available under? This guide answers these questions. Note: This guide focuses on data published by organisations based in the UK. Licensing law is different in different countries, so some of this information might not apply to you if you are based elsewhere. It does not address other potential legal considerations, such as compliance with the Data Protection Act. What Is Licensing? When you put care and thought into creating something, such as writing a blog post or taking a photograph, you own that work and you have certain rights, described below. If you have ownership of a work, and someone else wants to use it, they have to ask your permission. Licences are how you explicitly give someone else permission to use that work. You can transfer that ownership, which means that someone else now owns your work and has the rights associated with it. Usually your employment contract will state that work that you do as part of your employment is automatically transferred to your organisation, for example. You can also waive your rights, which places the work into the public domain and means anyone can do whatever they want with it. What Do You Own? In Europe, there are two kinds of rights that you are automatically given over things that you have created: you get copyright over works ( content ) that you create and which are original to you, such as text that you write or photographs you take you get a database right over collections of data that you have put a substantial effort into obtaining, verifying or presenting Note: As far as we know the database right only arises within the European Union and in Mexico. In some countries there may be no protection for collections of data. If you apply original judgement in putting together a database, for example in choosing which items to include within the database or which information about them to include, you have a copyright over that database, because it is a creative work. For example, if you were to build a database about the best 100 cars, this might involve: choosing which cars count as the best cars writing a description about each car researching and gathering facts about them You would have copyright over the database, because you chose which cars were \u201cbest\u201d. You would have copyright over the descriptions, because you wrote them. And you would probably have the database right for the database you\u2019ve built, because you put substantial effort into gathering information about them. Importantly, you don\u2019t own the facts about the cars \u2014 anyone else can build their own database containing exactly those facts without violating your database right \u2014 but no one else can reuse your database or your descriptions without your permission because you own the copyright over them. You probably do not have a database right if you create the facts in a database, as opposed to gathering them from elsewhere, unless you put substantial effort into verifying or presenting the database. For example, if you own a restaurant and create a database of the dishes that you offer and when you offer them, you probably do not have a database right over that database, though you might have copyright because of the creative judgement involved in working out which dishes should be offered on particular days to provide a balanced menu. Copyright and database right are types of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). There are other kinds of IPR that you can get, such as patents, trademarks and (some) design rights, which must be registered (for example with the Intellectual Property Office ). What About Data From Other Organisations? You might not own all the content or data that you have and use within your organisation. In particular, rather than creating the content or gathering the data yourself, some of the content and data you hold and use within your organisation, and might want to publish, might be: completely licensed from someone else include an extract of content or data that you have licensed from someone else be derived from the content or data that you have licensed from someone else The Reuser\u2019s Guide to Open Data Licensing describes what you can do with content or data that you licence from someone else. If you do reuse that content or data in your own publications, you should indicate the licence under which you are reusing that content, so that people reusing that content or data know what they can do with it. What About My Brand? Organisations who publish content or data under an open licence are often concerned that this might enable reusers to also copy their brand. Your brand should be protected through a trade mark . A trade mark restricts how other people use your logo or company name. You will also have copyright on the logo. Although your trade mark will protect you from other people using your logo directly, if your logo is incorporated into some content that you licence, you should make sure the logo is explicitly not covered by that licence, as you will usually want to place additional restrictions on its use (such as its adaptation). For example, if you have written a report that includes your logo, and you want to licence the content of the report under the Creative Commons Attribution licence, you could say: The text, figures and tables in this report are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License . Logos and other trade marks are not covered by this licence. What If I Publish the Data on a Website? You still have rights over your database and your content when you publish them on a website. Others cannot legally extract and reuse a substantial portion of your data or content without your permission. You can also indicate that others should not scrape data from your website through your Terms and Conditions and through technical mechanisms such as robots.txt . What Are Open Licences? An open licence is one that places very few restrictions on what anyone can do with the content or data that is being licensed. An open licence allows others to do things like: republish the content or data on their own website derive new content or data from yours make money by selling products that use your content or data republish the content or data while charging a fee for access According to the Open Definition , there are only two kinds of restrictions that an open licence can place: that reusers must give attribution to the source of the content or data that reusers must publish any derived content or data under the same licence (this is called share-alike ) An open licence might do neither or one or both of these, and you can choose which open licence to use when you publish open content or data. So, you can choose to make your content or data available under one of three levels of licence: a public domain licence has no restrictions at all (technically, these indicate that you waive your rights to the content or data) an attribution licence just says that reusers must give attribution to you an attribution & share-alike licence says that reusers must give attribution and share any derived content or data under the same licence What Open Licences Are There? There are two sets of open licences. You should use a licence from one of these sets rather than creating your own licence, for three reasons: it\u2019s less work it ensures that the legal language in the licence is correct it makes it a lot easier for reusers to know what they can do with your data Open Licences for Creative Content Creative content, such as text, photographs, slides and so on, should be licensed using a Creative Commons Licence . There are three of these that you should consider using for open content: Level of Licence Creative Commons Licence public domain CC0 attribution CC-by attribution & share-alike CC-by-sa Make sure that you use the latest (version 4.0) Creative Commons licences, which are international. The links in the table above go to the correct licences. There are other types of Creative Commons licences that are not open licences. For example, the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence does not allow commercial reuse of content, and therefore is not an open licence. If you use the Creative Commons licence chooser , only those that are described as \u201cFree Culture\u201d licences are open licences. Open Licences for Databases We now recommend that you also use a Creative Commons 4.0 licence for data as well as for content. You may alternatively use a similar set of licences that was created specifically for databases from the Open Data Commons . There are again three levels that you can choose from: Level of Licence Open Data Commons Licence public domain PDDL attribution ODC-by attribution & share-alike ODbL Other Licences Other licences that support reuse, which you might consider using, are: the UK Open Government Licence is an attribution licence that covers both copyright and database right which is mainly useful for the UK public sector Which Licence Should I Use? The licence that you use should support your open data business model . It is unusual for organisations to place content or data in the public domain as being given attribution for the content or data usually helps to achieve some of the goals of opening it up. It is possible to license content or data under more than one licence, and let reusers choose which licence to use it under. Typically you would dual-license some content or data by making it available under an open licence and under a paid-for licence that does not have the same restrictions. Dual-licensing is typically used with a share-alike licence, as outlined below. Some open data business models work best with a share-alike licence. For example: a share-alike licence will usually be unattractive to commercial businesses who don\u2019t want to open up their own data, so using a share-alike licence coupled with a charged licence can be a good basis for a freemium business model when you are collaborating with others to create a shared resource, a share-alike licence can help to ensure that you can bring back into that resource any work that others do on their own copies On the other hand, if you are hoping to gain other benefits for your business through the reuse of your data, using a cross-subsidy business model, you may find that a share-alike licence prevents people from reusing it, and therefore want to avoid having a share-alike restriction. There are two cases where you have no choice over what licence you can use for the content or data that you publish. If you are publishing content or data that is derived from content or data that was licenced to you using a share-alike licence, then you must publish your content or data using that same licence. With very few exceptions, if you are a government department or arms-length body then the content or data that you have created or gathered is owned by the Crown. Unless you have an exemption, granted by the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) , you must publish this data using the Open Government Licence . What Attribution Should I Ask For? If you choose a licence that includes a requirement for attribution, you need to specify what that attribution should look like. In choosing what attribution to ask for, you should consider the ways in which your data or content might be reused, and the fact that it might be combined with other data or content that might require its own attribution. If you want to encourage the reuse of your data or content, you need to make it easy for reusers to satisfy your attribution requirements. There are two things you should document: What should the attribution include? You will usually want the name of your organisation, and a link to either your organisation\u2019s home page or a page about the data or content you are licensing. Keep this as minimal as possible. Where and how should the attribution be presented? Some attribution requirements specify that the attribution must be presented directly wherever the data is used, and may even specify the size or format of the attribution. These requirements can be difficult to adhere to, particularly for mobile application developers who have limited screen space to include such attributions. Allowing reusers to provide attribution on a separate page makes this easier. Note that under the terms of the licences listed above, when a reuser uses your data or content to add value to or to create new data or content, they cannot relicense your work. Any onward reusers are bound by the same attribution requirements as the direct reusers of your content or data. It\u2019s a good idea to explicitly document this requirement because it might not be obvious to reusers. How Do I Indicate the Licence of Content or Data? You should indicate the licence for content or data you make available using both a human-readable description and computer-readable metadata. The clearer you make it which licence applies to your content or data, the easier it is for reusers to know that they can reuse the content or data you are licensing. The human-readable descriptions and marks that you should use are spelled out on the Creative Commons and Open Data Commons websites: Creative Commons licence chooser Open Data Commons licences It is best to embed information about the licence that some content or data is available under directly within the content or data. This ensures that the licensing information is carried around with the content or data. In addition to human-readable text, you should provide computer-readable metadata. The separate Publisher\u2019s Guide to the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary describes how to do this. If you add your dataset to a catalog, such as data.gov.uk or the Data Hub , you should make sure that you indicate the licence under which the dataset is available within that catalog. This gives people searching the catalog a quick and easy way of seeing that they will be able to reuse the dataset.

We still hadn\u2019t finished working out this ODI, and everyone we spoke to had a different idea about what an Open Data Institute might do. ODI is non-profit. Non-partisan. We responded to these requests by creating an open process, and an open conversation. In a remarkably short period of time (4 months), we went from some ideas, to documents, to signed agreements with 13 organisations around the world. I have spoken to well over 100 people, from dozens of groups, from over 30 countries. By email, by video Skype (with up to 4 organisations/countries at a time), and in person. It\u2019s the beginning of a voyage. I\u2019d like to share some of the things we\u2019ve learned over the last 16 weeks. There is huge positive intent almost everywhere: a willingness to try. You can build quickly. There are consequences of doing so. There is confusion. Lack of understanding had led to some distrust. How we follow-through will be critical. Before we started, we looked at a lot of different models, from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res to Human Rights Watch, from Github to Ushahidi. I combined this with my personal experience of creating organisations (ODI is the 9th company I\u2019ve helped to build over the last 20 years), with insights from our team, and many others. The ODI is new, it\u2019s well-funded, has unique founders and an amazing team. This is a privilege, and with such privilege comes a responsibility. I made a decision that it was our responsibility to experiment in the creation of a global open organisation. I didn\u2019t want to over-think this, I felt we would learn more by trying it. The ODI board, and the team, agreed. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. \u2014 proverb We made a choice, an active choice, to go fast. We chose to run with people and organisations that could wonder, and run, with us at a pace. I\u2019ve been blown away by the number of people willing to commit their time and energy to collaboration. People I\u2019ve never met have worked together, with obvious positive intent, built trust with us (we don\u2019t know everyone), trusted us (ODI is the new kid on the block, after all), and looked to a future where a global network might be able to make a difference. We are definitely not alone, but we (the whole open data community) are also not together. That we have any Nodes at all is a better outcome than I was expecting: the worst would have been that no one noticed. Our choice was to create a lightweight, fail-fast, \u201cmany-parts loosely-joined\u201d network \u2014 to see what was possible. To \u201cshake the tree\u201d. Don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good A natural and considered consequence of this was, and is, that we won\u2019t get it right. But, as we do with all our projects, it\u2019s better to start development, test it, fix it, iterate\u2026 my operating principle was \u2014 and still is \u2014 \u201ccode-test-fix-repeat\u201d, in an open environment. http://github.com/theodi/ODI is where that happens. People are (always) a lot harder than code I set up a mailing list. I added over 50 people who had explicitly asked to join in the conversation. Very few people used it. I think (but don\u2019t know) that many were interested in what might be being said, but very few were willing to put their own hand up (maybe they didn\u2019t feel empowered). So, after trying to stimulate conversation this way, I stopped. Instead I put out a call for \u201copen discussion sessions\u201d: time slots where I would be available on a video Skype or Google Hangout for anyone from the group to join, and discuss what we all might want to do. We set them up for 8am, 5pm, 10pm, to cover all the time-zones. I turned up. Almost no one else did. So we stopped trying that. We then went for the labour-intensive route. My (exceptional) assistant, Jade, contacted people individually to set up small, dedicated calls for me with 3-4 people from different organisations or countries. We did over 20 of these in 2 weeks. During each call I made an open Google Doc for everyone on the call to see my notes, and their notes, about the call. Suddenly, we had progress. Fast progress. People edited the proto-contracts during the calls. Everyone, collectively, came up with the names of the Nodes: Country, City/Region, Communications (initially I called them level 1, 2, 3). People asked lots of questions. Then we all answered them. The single most powerful component of the process was this (on first calls with new people): me: \u201chere is the draft contract we\u2019ve created\u201d them: \u201cwe don\u2019t understand how X might work\u201d [slightly apprehensive about ODI\u2019s intent] me: \u201cneither do I, could you edit it with what you think?\u201d them: \u201coh!\u201d they edit in changes to the contract [trust built, this is now a collaboration] I can\u2019t overstate how often this repeated and how much it broke the ice on a new relationship. Quickly the questions turned into patterns, and everyone became \u201ccomfortable enough\u201d with the intent, the deliverables, and the financial model. For me, it was quite a \u201chigh density\u201d data and communications process. I think there was only one time I introduced someone to the person who\u2019d introduced them to me in the first place. Outcomes In the 2 weeks leading up to the first ODI Summit, 13 organisations from around the world, signed a contract to become an ODI Node. Their commitment: time, energy, and money. Our commitment: time, energy, and money. More on the money later\u2026 The ODI provides training, research and development, and incubates startups. It bridges between commercial, public sector, research and third sector communities. Nodes are attached to existing organisations (for-profit, non-profit, or academic), and not to individuals, in-part to reflect the ODI\u2019s commercial focus. The focus for our Node conversations were to Support a community. Bring a project to collaborate on. (or, if you are a Communications Node, bring stories and use-cases) Key themes are around amplifying what is there, growing the reach of open data \u2014 for everyone . The risk The board, rightly, asked me a very important question. We\u2019re a new organisation. You don\u2019t know what these Nodes might do, we don\u2019t have much/any control. Why would you put our hard-won brand at such risk with this idea? My answer was It is a risk. But what is the risk if we don\u2019t do it? What is the opportunity? The worst-case is we pick the wrong organisation to be a Node, or they do something damaging. If they do, they stop being a Node. This is why we have an ODI Charter, a licensed brand, and a central registry. It\u2019s certain we won\u2019t be able to have certainty, and we\u2019ll make mistakes. And, certainly, we will. Even before the Nodes idea, we heard that some felt confused or even threatened by ODI. Since, I\u2019ve heard comments ranging from ODI, are they friend or foe? to They ignored existing open data community X in Y to We\u2019ve been doing this for X years. Who do they think they are? We recognise that there are lots of people already working in the space, and doing great things. We want to add to those activities, not take away from them. We are coming to this with positive intent. We are working it out as we go along, and have to be able to make mistakes rather than being frozen into inactivity for fear of doing the wrong thing. We are working to build a new organisation, called the Open Data Institute. ODI\u2019s mission is to help catalyse the evolution of open data culture . We\u2019ve done almost everything completely in the open. We don\u2019t know everything, or know everyone, and we never can. Everyone is limited in time, energy, and money. We\u2019re all, every one of us, working it out. If people are asking about what the ODI does, please share this page, or our first Annual Report . Please ask if you\u2019d like hard-copies to share (they are lovely things). If you know anyone we should be reaching out to, please let me know (my email is gavin@theodi.org ). About the money Money is like a sixth sense without which you cannot make a complete use of the other five. \u2014 Maugham I strongly believe that part of the ODI\u2019s responsibility is to increase the amount of money to the whole the open data landscape. I have been reminded, almost daily, of the 1990s. Huge numbers of talented, passionate people built the open web, often unpaid, and the foundations of where we all are today. Then, as the money flowed in, different sets of people benefited. Often the volunteers, the innovators, who made amazing things, stayed unpaid or worse, unrecognised, for their works. There are many stories on those mountains. I don\u2019t want to see this happen again, but I see it coming in the open data landscape. McKinsey said only 2 weeks ago that open data would be worth up to $5 trillion a year. I\u2019m concerned that the same things will happen again as in the 90s. We want to help do things differently this time. Tim and Nigel\u2019s vision was that the ODI should catalyse the demand-side of open data. If there isn\u2019t demand, then there\u2019s no need for the supply \u2014 that\u2019s a big risk. My job is to help ODI make that demand-side work. For me, to make it work, everyone\u2019s work needs to be operationally sustainable, which means people need to be paid, properly. A lot more money has to flow towards open data people, and open data places. We have already demonstrated that it is possible to bring in new money: over $1m of commercial income from ODI Members in 6 months, over $3m of prize funds, over $20m of development funding. These are big numbers with one lens, and tiny numbers when we look at the scale of what\u2019s needed. How do we get a million people involved in making a difference (social, economic, and environmental) using open data? How do we help bring 0.1% ($1bn) of that McKinsey figure to making that difference? ODI charges Nodes To instil this commercial focus in the Node models, we have borrowed from franchise-like models. ODI licenses its brand. For small companies this is a \u201cnominal amount\u201d, \u00a350. I picked a number (it could have been \u00a31) so we could raise an invoice. Raising an invoice and getting paid tests a lot about processes, and cements our contracts. The fee is more for big organisations. For material work, we have put an initial stake in the ground of 10% of Node-related revenue (with the ability to exempt certain work). For example, some Nodes want to provide paid-for training, and are happy passing 10% back to us. Some will get local grants which 10% can\u2019t be shared from. This is fine. I don\u2019t know if 10% is the right number, but I do want to create an economic flow. If we get this right, I believe we can do three critical things: we can help co-fund projects across the network we can help fundraise both centrally to support projects, and support local/distributed fundraising we can communicate the economic growth of the open data community, which is crucial to points 1 and 2 What next I thought we might, with a favourable wind, have 4 or 5 Nodes by the Summit. We have 13 in 9 countries, and this is set to grow very soon. Our next step is to talk, with each other, with you. We now have time to put in some code (e.g. what project will someone deliver), some tests (e.g. did it have any impact), processes (e.g. how well was communication managed), and iterate (e.g. adding metrics). The commitment we\u2019re making is to iterate. ODI has run, quickly, to establish the beginnings of a global presence. The cadence we have inside the UK ODI is to move quickly, then take time to listen and reflect on concrete evidence, test, and iterate. This is our mode of development. Questions we\u2019ll address include accrediting trainers, syndicating membership, and using open data certificates. We will share our knowledge, showcase the work of the Nodes and the whole community, and work out how the global network can coordinate on issues, resources, and funding. We want to solve problems. Our mission statement is, I hope, really clear: \u201ccatalyse the evolution of open data culture\u201d. This, is for everyone.","slug":"node-knowledge-november-2013","tag_ids":["blog","odi"],"format":"blog","created_at":"2013-11-18T17:58:57+00:00"}}]}
