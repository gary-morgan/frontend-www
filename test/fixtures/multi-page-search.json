The project is part of the ODI\u2019s Data as Culture programme, now in its second year. \u2018We Need Us\u2019 is one of dozens of original works that will be featured in the coming months by The Space, a new creative online platform to showcase the world\u2019s most exciting digital art. Today\u2019s launch at Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall is supported by artists including David Hockney, Marina Abramovic and Ai Weiwei. The Space is jointly funded by the BBC and the Arts Council. ODI President and co-founder, Sir Tim Berners-Lee said: Artists wake us up to all that happens in the world. The Space and the ODI can make that happen on the web. \u2018We Need Us\u2019 is a live online animated artwork that explores big data. The work concentrates on metadata which it draws from the activities of Zooniverse\u2019s million+ participants, to create an environment of sounds and animated forms. Unlike traditional data-visualisation which helps people understand and make sense of information held in large data sets, \u2018We Need Us\u2019 investigates the unique properties of the data itself. Artist, Julie Freeman said: Imagine a web where we stumble and fall into art as we do in real-life. The Space is a starting point for this to happen, bringing works like \u2018We Need Us\u2019 to everyone; I\u2019m delighted to be one of the first co-commissioned artists. Working in residence at the Open Data Institute has enabled me to work with data in a deep way, interrogating it as an art material, looking for the growth, momentum and fragility within it. The work I\u2019m creating requires data from online activities of people to come alive. The idea is to remind people of the humanity in technology - that we need \u2018us\u2019 as much as we need it. ODI CEO, Gavin Starks said: Using open data as a creative material helps us understand how it touches all our lives: our own data, or data about us, about our society, our financial system, our health, our environment \u2013 all have impacts that affect us every day, personally, locally and globally. \u2018We Need Us\u2019 is literal in its reflection of this: the work is built on millions of interactions from over a million people, working together to solve massive-scale problems. We are delighted that The Space is partnering to co-commission with ODI, and building on our Data as Culture programme - which views data as part of our cultural landscape. Ruth Mackenzie, Launch Director of The Space said: The Space will commission around 50 new works a year from great artists, both known and unknown, and share them freely with audiences from around the World. We are delighted that the ODI is involved in the programme. \u2018We Need Us\u2019 promises to be a dynamic and imaginative work. It\u2019s very much in the spirit of The Space which will generate new art and maybe new art forms - what an amazing opportunity for all of us to try to see into the future.","slug":"odi-cocommissions-original-artwork-with-the-space","tag_ids":["odi","news"],"format":"news","created_at":"2014-06-12T16:37:51+01:00"}},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/friday-lunchtime-lecture-building-an-open-digital-public-space.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/friday-lunchtime-lecture-building-an-open-digital-public-space","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Building an Open Digital Public Space","details":{"description":"The Victorians built vast galleries and museums to house cultural and scientific collections; they were opened to the public and used for educational research.

The node now has a home, has founding membership and has confirmed its first events and training courses. As of March 10th we have taken space on the top floor of Munro House , which will be the home for ODI-Leeds, The Leeds Civic Lab and Leeds Impact Hub. We are busy preparing the space and it will officially open on May 6th. Watch out on our Twitter feed for the before, during and after photos. The ODI-Leeds, Civic Lab and Impact Hub will be a place where projects are completed, where value is created and where people will work together, using data and open principles, to create benefit for the City Region of Leeds. It will also be the place that connects us to the ODI and back out to the global ODI-Node network. We need to thank our confirmed Founding Members, who have provided financial and resource support as we have moved from a great idea, to a start-up, to a physical space in a matter of four months. These are: Leeds City Council Leeds Data Mill Leeds Health Innovation Hub West Yorkshire Metro Leeds CC Smart City Team Bloom Agency CITU Additional foundation members will be confirmed over the next few months. We are still recruiting, so if your business or organisation wants to play a part in establishing ODI-Leeds please contact us (details at the bottom of this post). The space will be used for three main purposes: Collaboration space for projects in the Civic Lab Hosting of member teams working on Open Data and Technology Projects Events and Training The ODI-Leeds will live-stream the ODI Friday lunchtime lectures and will be open to everyone on Friday afternoons to discuss projects, ideas or just drink tea and eat cake.

The research afternoon brought together academics, innovators and businesses to share research and development. In an era of rapid urbanisation we are witnessing increasing demand for additional housing, infrastructure, transport and green spaces to name but a few. We are asking, how open data can help tackle these challenges and how it is already being used by innovative businesses. Prof. Derek McAuley , Prof. Darren Robinson from the University of Nottingham and Prof. Gerd Kortuem from Open University outlined their current research and shared their views on what the next ten years may hold in this field.

Thanks to our active participation in the open data community, in September we could begin a conversation that eventually made FBK a city Node of the ODI. Starting from January 2014, FBK has established a brand new unit, The Digital Commons Lab, under the supervision of Maurizio Napolitano; it was assigned an autonomous space, located within the ICT Center, which will officially deliver projects as The ODI Node. As our first commitment as an ODI Node, we are currently translating the Open Data Certificates into Italian. The translation team is composed of Maurizio Napolitano and Francesca De Chiara, members of the ODI node in Trento, and of Leda Bargiotti, a legal expert working for the Publications Office of the European Union in Luxembourg. The translation work is carried out as a collaborative project, and will be completed by January 2014. Further, the ODI Node - Trento is promoting the diffusion of the open data certificates in Italy: certificates are meant to be adopted by a large Italian power company, keen on testing and rating the quality of their released and available datasets. Developing the Open Data Certificates for our regional open data catalog will be the next step. We are also involved in a national initiative with a potentially large impact: the Italian government agency AGID (Agency for the Italian Digital Agenda) is now writing up the final document of the national guidelines for the usage of digital instruments in the public administration, and the ODI Node Trento is deeply involved in the public discussion as a key contributor. Our proposal is to include in the final document the use of the Open Data Certificates (the Italian version) as an official recommendation. At present we are discussing the creation of an autonomous Italian Open Data Institute, named \u201cIstituto Italiano per i Dati Aperti\u201d; the initiative stemmed from a group of consultants of the public administration. We are pointing out the need of a synergy with the ODI, that would eventually be carried out by our node. We\u2019ll address another challenge: developing validation instruments to enhance data accuracy and reliability, especially in the case of crowdsourced projects. We are interested in spreading the use of OpenStreetMap in order to raise citizens\u2019 awareness and participatory planning (for example in case of emergencies). The fast progress in the mapping activity in the city of Matera (historical town in the Southern Italy) and the recent tragic events related to the Cleopatra cyclone in Sardinia show how valuable and necessary these collaborative and community-driven initiatives are. We are also planning to run training sessions, focused on open data reuse and digital storytelling; to stimulate the demand and conversation around the data involving NGOs, local companies and local government institutions. The lab\u2019s members will also undertake at least one research project, involving some partners, and draft proposals in order to get funding.","slug":"trento-node-news-2014","tag_ids":["odi","page"],"format":"page","created_at":"2014-01-24T12:45:10+00:00"}},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/data-as-culture-artist-stanzas-real-time-city-of-bits-installation-opens-in-norway.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/data-as-culture-artist-stanzas-real-time-city-of-bits-installation-opens-in-norway","title":"Guest post: Data as Culture artist, Stanza\u2019s, Real Time City of Bits installation opens in Norway","details":{"description":"The Tr\u00f8ndelag Centre for Contemporary Art , Norway is presenting British artist Stanza with his \u2018The Emergent City. A Life From Complexity to The City of Bits\u2019. Three large scale installation by Stanza including a Mini, Mechanical Metropolis Runs On Real-Time Urban Data captures the changes over time in the environment (city) and represents the changing life and complexity of space as an emergent artwork. The artwork explores new ways of thinking about life, emergence and interaction within public space.The project uses environmental monitoring technologies and security based technologies, to question audiences\u2019 experiences of real time events and create visualisations of life as it unfolds. The installation goes beyond simple single user interaction to monitor and survey in real time the whole city and entirely represent the complexities of the real time city as a shifting morphing complex system. The data and their interactions \u2013 that is, the events occurring in the environment that surrounds and envelops the installation \u2013 are translated into the force that brings the electronic city to life by causing movement and change \u2013 that is, new events and actions \u2013 to occur. In this way the city performs itself in real time through its physical avatar or electronic double: The city performs itself through an-other city. Cause and effect become apparent in a discreet, intuitive manner, when certain events that occur in the real city cause certain other events to occur in its completely different, but seamlessly incorporated, double. The avatar city is not only controlled by the real city in terms of its function and operation, but also utterly dependent upon it for its existence. Contemporary art with the ambition of illuminating transformative processes as aesthetic phenomena. Among them is The Emergent City (2012) \u2013 an electronic city with hundreds of electronic components that receives and processes information from a network of wireless sensors, that the artist has placed around Trondheim city centre. Stanza uses multiple new technologies to create distances between real time multi point perspectives that emphasis a new visual space. The purpose of this is to communicate feelings and emotions that we encounter daily which impact on our lives and which are outside our control. The Emergent City is an \u201cOpen social sculpture that informs the world and creates new meaningful artistic experiences. The artwork is also a highly technical project that gives vast amounts of information about the environment. By embedding the sensors like this we can re-engage with the fabric of space itself and enable new artistic metaphors within the environment.\u201d In the exhibition: Body 01000010011011110110010001111001 Body is a sculpture commissioned for the ODI\u2019s first Data as Culture exhibition which responds to the emergent properties of the environment The Emergent City.
