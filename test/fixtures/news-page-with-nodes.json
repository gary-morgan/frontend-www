This list will enable the public to see the wide range of activity in the community and the innovation that is happening in Canada around Open Data. The list will also assist organizations discovering other organizations that might provide partnering or collaboration opportunities The methodology and processes will follow the work of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://thegovlab.org/\">GovLab</a> at NYU on their work on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opendata500.com/\">Open Data 500</a> in the United States.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open Data Reference Model</strong></p>\n\n<p>In all sectors there is a need for standards, and the same applies to the Open Data community. CODI has initiated a project which seeks to evolve the Municipal Data Reference Model to an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatainstitute.ca/projects/\">Open Data Reference Mode</a>l that can apply initially to public sector data and subsequently to include NGO data to assist in the ease and consistency of open data discovery and use. The project focuses on three areas: standardizing the categories/groups for data sets (possible use as tags); adding &ldquo;Also Known As&rdquo; names of data sets; and to initiate an inventory of existing standards and organizations involved in standards related to the open data community. Preliminary discussions have been held on potential collaboration from a local \u2013 global level. All are invited to contribute!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open Data Request Framework</strong></p>\n\n<p>CODI is working with Cycle Toronto to develop a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatainstitute.ca/projects/\">framework</a>that can be reused by any community member or group who wants open data and is new to asking for it and/or using it in their advocacy efforts. This will include a process to help identify: what kind of data is available to any given community, what kind of data will be helpful to advocacy objectives, who to ask for the data, how to ask for it, how to best use it in advocacy (e.g. data visualizations, applications), how to advocate for data sets that don\u2019t yet exist and how to share the process with others in the community, as well as other elements to add to the framework that are uncovered through the case study.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Academic Open Data Research Repository</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is an increasing amount of research being undertaken on open data. A project is being initiated by CODI to facilitate the creation/expansion of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatainstitute.ca/projects/\">Academic Open Data Research repository</a>. Community discussions have confirmed the value of having a single, searchable repository of not only existing academic papers/studies but also to introduce planned research projects. There has been a preliminary review of the possible use of the Open Research Network\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/opening_science/items/collectionKey/5A7JAT67\">Zotero Open Data Research repository</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Community Engagement</strong></p>\n\n<p>CODI maintains community engagement as a primary task. In collaboration with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.urbandigital.ca/\">urban + digital</a>, CODI co-hosted an event <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://airmail.calendar/2013-12-13%2012:00:00%20GMT\">on December 13th</a> with guest speaker Jean-No\u00e9 Landry from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://montrealouvert.net/\">Montreal Ouvert</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://quebecouvert.org/\">Qu\u00e9bec Ouvert</a> to share success stories from Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s open data community with the Toronto community.

For example, the tools of surveillance are available to many - as illustrated in James Bridle work showing \u201csecret\u201d drones visible using public satellite maps. The comedic open data book stabber reflects how truly tedious and mundane data gathering and processing is. We want to ensure conversations about open data expand beyond specialist communities and through to the general public.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shiri Shalmy, commissioned curator, said, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cThe exhibition presents a wide range of creative approaches to the use of data, intentionally moving away from screen-based representations of information and instead experimenting with the possibilities of manifesting data in physical form. While in some cases visitors are asked to simply join the dots, in others they must respond to the artist\u2019s call: give us your data!\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The exhibition will be open to members of the public during office hours, Monday to Friday.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, ODI CEO Gavin Starks and FivebyFive\u2019s Kat Borlongan all spoke at the conference about the potential for open data, and the importance of openness and transparency.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, ODI CEO said</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Open data in France has taken a huge leap forward this week. Today\u2019s Presidential event with ODI Paris and Snips, and the fact that France has joined the OGP, show that the French government is acting to catalyse the huge business opportunities that open data can bring; to drive open innovation and better services for French citizens. We look forward to seeing the French government support startup companies working with open data to reach their potential.   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Francis Maude, Cabinet Office Minister, welcomed France\u2019s move to join the OGP in his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/francis-maude-welcomes-france-to-the-open-government-partnership\">speech </a>and commented:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Open Data Institute, started in London by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt, is now operating here in Paris too. It\u2019s a great example of how much we can do together. By operating across different countries, it can unlock the best supplies of data, generate demand and enhance our knowledge of its potential to address common issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Kat Borlongan, co-founder of FivebyFive said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It&rsquo;s almost shocking how many complex problems open data can solve. It&rsquo;s a big step forward for FivebyFive, as a young startup, to be invited to sit down with the President over lunch and not just tell him but show him what we mean. It sends a strong signal to the open data community as a whole and makes us even more hopeful for the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rand Hindi from Snips said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is a real honour to be invited to discuss such important topics with the French President. As a startup specialising in modelling how people and cities interact, we rely heavily on open data to build contextual models of urban environments. We can already predict passenger flow in public transport, car accidents and crime. The more data we can access, the more problems we can solve, thus contributing to making cities a better place to live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"News: French President talks open data with ODI Paris and ODI Supporter, Snips, at exclusive honorary lunch","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://www.dev/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[{"name":"Paris","slug":"paris","level":"city","beta":true,"web_url":"http://www.dev/nodes/paris"}]},"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://www.dev/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[{"name":"Paris","slug":"paris","level":"city","beta":true,"web_url":"http://www.dev/nodes/paris"}],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/open-data-in-the-judiciaries-of-argentina-chile-and-uruguay.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/blog/open-data-in-the-judiciaries-of-argentina-chile-and-uruguay","slug":"open-data-in-the-judiciaries-of-argentina-chile-and-uruguay","title":"Guest blog post: Open Data in the judiciaries of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-08-20T16:59:46+01:00","created_at":"2014-06-03T15:47:24+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://www.dev/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/buenos-aires-node-news-2014.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/buenos-aires-node-news-2014","slug":"buenos-aires-node-news-2014","title":"Buenos Aires  node news: January 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-08-20T16:59:28+01:00","created_at":"2014-01-24T12:48:44+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"Open data judiciary Argentina, Chile, Uruguay","excerpt":"In 2013 CIPPEC\u2019s Justice program developed the project Emerging Impacts in Open Data that focused on the judiciaries of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay*.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p>In 2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cippec.org\">CIPPEC\u2019s</a> Justice program developed the project <em>Emerging Impacts in Open Data</em> that focused on the judiciaries of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay*.</p>\n\n<p>CIPPEC&rsquo;s study focuses on the openness of judiciary data and its impact.

During that period, I completed my Masters dissertation in which I investigated public participation in the use of Open Government Data in the United Kingdom. In a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-post-shifting-environments-at-the-odi\">previous post</a> I offered some reflections on my experiences as an intern here. Now I want to share more of the &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of my research.</p>\n\n<p>I began this project with a background in political studies and a keen interest in Open Data\u2019s (potential) benefits. Informing my work additionally with experience gained through my Masters degree in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/cerch/study/madam/index.aspx\">Digital Asset Management (DAM)</a>, I sought to approach this research as an Open Data outsider: I was interested in how the \u201cgeneral public\u201d (that amorphous concept of basically\u2026 everyone) could engage with the data being opened by their governments. I started with the understanding that, in our democratic societies, the <em>government&rsquo;s</em> data is the <em>people&rsquo;s</em> data. </p>\n\n<p>I endeavoured to examine the UK\u2019s Open Government Data environment from the horse\u2019s mouth. My research focus was firstly on material produced by the government (such as the extremely useful <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-the-potential\">Open Data White Paper</a>) My secondary research focus was on material about the government\u2019s Open Data approaches (such as the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\">Shakespeare Review</a>). The aim of this approach - balancing government discourse with non-government content - was again to address the linkage between the government and &ldquo;the people&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<h3>Low engagement</h3>\n\n<p>My findings (informed, for example, by the Cabinet Office\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/\">Digital Landscape Research</a>, data.gov.uk <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/blog/site-usage\">site usage information</a>, and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.listpoint.co.uk/Attachments/Listpoint%20research%20rel%20final.pdf\">&ldquo;Inaugural Public Sector Benchmark Survey on Open Data&rdquo;</a>) indicated that public participation in the use of Open Government Data - direct engagement with government data by the populace - is limited, specialised, and low. </p>\n\n<p>Open Data engagement tends to come from specialised actors - developers, entrepreneurs, some business specialists, and other tech-savvy agents. But if government data is indeed the people&rsquo;s data, then evidently there should be a desire to widen this engagement. The Uk government has in fact professed the desire, in this regard, to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/video/2013/apr/29/can-government-data-change-the-world-post-event-video\">widen participation</a>. Likewise, the United Nations <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://workspace.unpan.org/sites/Internet/Documents/Guidenlines%20on%20OGDCE%20May17%202013.pdf\">has argued</a> that such engagement is a human right. </p>\n\n<p>So, what might be causing such low participation? Ultimately, addressing this question is the first essential step towards any attempt to expand engagement. Laying the foundations through this question I explored four basic issues that appear to be hampering the expansion of Open Participation:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Data/information conflation</h3>\n\n<p>I was wary to begin my work with such an epistemological point, but the government\u2019s conflation of notions of data and notions of information seems to be causing something of a \u201cfirst lap\u201d participation stumbling block. The government\u2019s definition of Open Government Data - as found in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-the-potential\">Open Data White Paper</a> - describes making \u201cPublic Sector Information\u201d (PSI) open. </p>\n\n<p>PSI is both data - what the government defines as symbols that are \u201cnot the product of analysis or interpretation\u201d - and information - what the government defines as that developed through a \u201cprocess that summarises, interprets or otherwise represents data to convey meaning\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>It may seem trivial, but this sort of basic definitional conflation requires ongoing examination and questioning. If Open Government Data is both data <em>and</em> information, how is it to be used? In what way(s)? Does Open Government Data exist as non-analysed symbols or as processed answers to questions? Can it (comprehensibly) be both at once? </p>\n\n<h3>2. Audience</h3>\n\n<p>Issue one is epistemological, but issue two certainly is not and stems directly from the data/information conflation: Who is Open Government Data for? </p>\n\n<p>The UK government is fond of saying \u201ceveryone\u201d, \u201cthe people\u201d, \u201cbusinesses\u201d, \u201cusers\u201d, or similar catch-all terms. Targeting Open Government Data (or anything, for that matter) at \u201ceveryone\u201d or at under-defined and -understood audience groups raises a serious concern: not everyone is the same. </p>\n\n<p>Different people have different needs, abilities, and desires. One \u201cproduct\u201d (Open Government Data <em>en masse</em>) will not meet the needs of \u201ceveryone\u201d. If Open Government Data doesn\u2019t speak to - or attempt to speak to - a particular person\u2019s needs and abilities, why should they engage with it?</p>\n\n<h3>3. Intermediaries</h3>\n\n<p>The UK Open Government Data environment is reliant on the work of intermediaries: specialist actors who manipulate raw data into processed outcomes (e.g. apps). As the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/video/2013/apr/29/can-government-data-change-the-world-post-event-video\">Cabinet Office\u2019s Director of Transparency and Open Data put it</a>: \u201cthe default model is we get the data out, developers do their stuff, and the public benefits through that\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>But, as even he admits, this is suboptimal from the point of view of assisting citizens with their right to engage with <em>their</em> public data. </p>\n\n<p>The government is not preventing people from participating. However, participation is low and the environment relies on specialist users who develop raw data into more widely usable information outputs.</p>\n\n<p>The layers that develop between the people and their public data (data/information conflation, audience confusion, intermediary actors) are apparent.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Overemphasis on data supply</h3>\n\n<p>Too much emphasis is placed by the UK government on the supply of data and not enough focus is placed on understanding, generating, and nurturing data demand or data use. If public data is seen as the people&rsquo;s own data, it seems essential that all stages of its lifecycle - production, publication, consumption - be equally nourished.</p>\n\n<p>To accompany the Shakespeare Review, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/198905/bis-13-743-market-assessment-of-public-sector-information.pdf\">Deloitte produced a market assessment report</a>, which included an illustration of the UK\u2019s current Open Government Data environment. </p>\n\n<p>The diagram below is a redrawing of part of Deloitte&rsquo;s illustration. It is notable how the government sits at the supply end of a linear flow. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/8d/e9/528de926f362be664f00006a/Screen_shot_2013-11-21_at_11.05.47.png\" alt=\"Alt\" /></p>\n\n<p>There are good mechanisms in place to enable data requests - a way of pushing against the one way flow. However, even these are still about data release: getting this feedback only enables the government to push more data out, it does not address the usability or demand of this data (the right hand side of this diagram).</p>\n\n<h3>Digital ecosystem reconceptualisation</h3>\n\n<p>In my paper I offered a reconceptualisation of the UK\u2019s current Open Government Data environment. I based this on the thinking of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_ecosystem\">digital ecosystems</a>, which I saw as &ldquo;the digital counterparts of biological ecosystems&rdquo; (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4205344\">Brisco and De Wilde</a>): as cyclical, sustainable, demand-driven environments oriented around the agents of various species who are mutually interdependent in the delivery of effective and efficient value (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://nparc.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/npsi/ctrl\">Boley and Chang</a>; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2011/03/31/building-the-open-data-ecosystem/\">Pollock</a>; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/4/900\">Harrison, Pardo, and Cook</a>). </p>\n\n<p>I sought to conceptualise the environment using this metaphorical framework. I did not attempt to change the environment or stipulate policy changes, but rather to provide a theoretical framework within which the system as it exists could be reexamined.</p>\n\n<p>My reconceptualisation, in a nutshell, was about ascribing more appreciation to the \u201cthings\u201d of Open Government Data, the \u201cdoers\u201d of Open Government Data, and the process that relate these to each other. </p>\n\n<p>Using digital ecosystem terminology, I offered an understanding of the environment as being made up of clear and distinct (but related):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>entities</strong> (data and information) and </li>\n  <li><strong>agents</strong> (the government, intermediaries, and other actors including the public, businesses, and community groups).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I assert that, much as in a biological ecosystem, these entities and agents should all interact, interrelate, and benefit from one another. This is illustrated below.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/8d/ea/528dea31d0d4622bf5000074/Screen_shot_2013-11-21_at_11.10.20.png\" alt=\"Alt\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>Thinking about Open Government Data as a biological ecosystem is useful. Taking the biological foundations, agents can be imagined as sharks and whales (just as an example!) and entities as crustaceans and fish. A whale needs crustaceans for its sustenance, but sharks require fish and will not thrive if they can only eat crustaceans. </p>\n\n<p>In this example, there is a clear distinction between the demands of various agents - between the demands of the whales and the demands of the sharks. The whole ecosystem interrelates (crustaceans-fish-sharks-whales), exists as one, and relies on feedbacks and interdependencies. Crucially, the system is not dualised: there aren&rsquo;t just \u201cfood\u201d entities and \u201cdiner\u201d entities. Instead, there are <em>types</em> of food and <em>types</em> of diners: some food entities can be diner entities and some diners can become food. </p>\n\n<p>I applied this structure of interrelationships and interdependencies, supported by clear differentiations, to my thinking of the Open Government Data environment. This is about distinguishing between data and information (so that there is clarity about who might use which entity for what purpose) and between various agents: all are connected, nominally equal, and inter-reliant. </p>\n\n<p>The concept behind this framework is that government does not have to only push data to intermediaries, who push information to consumers. Instead, it is possible for all agents to have the ability to interrelate more dynamically. </p>\n\n<p>Fundamentally, this is about a frame of mind and operation. This is about seeing the Open Government Data environment as one in which greater interrelationships - and wider <em>direct participation</em> - are possible. </p>\n\n<p>When the core of the ecosystem is an inherently shared resource (government data being the people&rsquo;s public data) this is essential. It is essential for the rights of the agents and it is essential for the healthy and sustainable survival of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3>OpenDataCommunities</h3>\n\n<p>To illustrate this theoretical argument, I made considerable use of the excellent linked data portal developed by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government\">Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG)</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The department&rsquo;s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/\">Open Data Communities</a> site, in contrast to the government\u2019s central data portal, operates with a considerable degree of digital ecosystems thinking. On this site data and information are distinguished while still being provided through a single access point. </p>\n\n<p>The screenshot below illustrates this. Note the online viewable data and downloadable CSV data: casual users can get data easily, without a big download, while from the same source a more involved and technically-inclined agent (e.g. a developer) can access and manipulate a CSV download.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/8d/eb/528deb45d0d4622bf5000076/Screen_shot_2013-11-21_at_11.14.33.png\" alt=\"Alt\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>The re-conceptualisations I put forward in my paper are not big, but they are significant. </p>\n\n<p>Government data is the people\u2019s data. It is vital to ensure that as many people as possible can access their data and use their data. This means ironing out some of the ongoing and foundational issues at the heart of the current Open Government Data environment. This will ultimately benefit the rights of people to engage with their data.

She has a special blend of deep technical know how and an intuitive sense of what works in the world of the Web.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Jeni the ODI has a fantastic CTO and the open data community a great role model.

It\u2019s embarrassing: I more or less agree with everything that it says, without me really feeling concerned.  </p>\n\n<p>Fundamentally, I think Evelyne Ruppert reasons from an implicit idea that I would qualify as a &ldquo;model of double mistrust.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Her implicit reading of the Open Data movement is the following: as a response to the increasing mistrust of citizens, governments decided to release certain information allowing citizens to control them better, hoping to restore this confidence. </p>\n\n<p>I do not know if this reasoning exists elsewhere. One feels that this is related to the British context where open data is hard to separate from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2014/08/04/lopen-data-est-leurre-politique-254056\">Big Society</a> project. </p>\n\n<p>However, what I know is that this is not the context of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.etalab.gouv.fr/article-la-feuille-de-route-du-gouvernement-en-matiere-d-ouverture-et-de-partage-des-donnees-publiques-115767801.html\">French government</a>, and that it is not the spirit in which Etalab works. </p>\n\n<p>In France, the opening and sharing of public data is not seen as an end by itself, but rather levers that can service three objectives:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>a more complete democracy;</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>innovation and growth;</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>and a more efficient public action. </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Transparency, &ldquo;accountability,&rdquo; participation\u2026</h3>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the democratic dimension. In France, opening data does not rely on a value granted to &ldquo;transparency.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, I am personally not a fan of this concept. I find in it an apolitical apathy, traces of the theory of the invisible hand, and ignorance of the resources of human activity. </p>\n\n<p>I prefer more the concept of responsibility or accountability, which recognizes the entire dignity of the subject that exercises its responsibilities. </p>\n\n<p>Opening of public data in France is founded on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/decouvrir-l-assemblee/histoire/histoire-de-l-assemblee-nationale/le-temps-de-l-invention-1789-1799\">Declaration of Human Rights and the Citizen</a>, and its article 15:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>&ldquo;Society has a right to demand for an account from every public agent of his/her administration&rdquo;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cada.fr/textes-et-liens,6058.html\">Cada law</a>, which is a legislative translation of this article 15, deals with &ldquo;administrative documents&rdquo; (memos, opinions, notes, letters, files, databases, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>We feel that it is not a question of placing the administration in glass displays, of spying on all exchanges, of dragging everything to the spotlight, in all circumstances. It is a question of making public acts of responsibility, &ldquo;documents&rdquo; that an author worked on where s/he is responsible for notably to his/her superiors. </p>\n\n<p>The law provides for the bearing of this responsibility before the citizens. It does not ban hesitation, the secrets of the deliberation, the preparation of the decision. </p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, it provides as well several exceptions to this principle of publication: protection of the right to privacy, national security, secrets protected by law. </p>\n\n<h3>We do not ask the State to describe reality.</h3>\n\n<p>Consequently, the law regulates as well the question of data that the State has to produce and share, which seems to worry Evelyne Ruppert. We do not ask the State to describe reality. We ask it to share with simplicity the data that it uses within the framework of its public service missions as they are used. </p>\n\n<p>There is no need to open the epistemological question of the meaning of the data, from the point of view that it dissimulates possible observation biases. </p>\n\n<p>Open Data is not the public statistics office, and neither is it a great story through which the State tells us what to think\u2026It is the sharing of instruments with which the State works, and on which it bases its decisions. It&rsquo;s the search for a second life and of a new use for the knowledge that the States creates through its daily activity. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are other activities that the State keeps secret for more or less good reasons. There are democratic battles to reduce the perimeter of secrecy. But that are also many other jobs that are taking more and more steps to share, and that are learning to find new efficiencies thanks to the relationships opened through sharing. </p>\n\n<p>Evidently, opening data is nothing without dialogue and consultation around the data: the aim is to create the conditions for an active, informed, and responsable citizenry. </p>\n\n<p>Exchanging with the users of this data, responding to their questions, compiling criticisms and suggestions is one of the essential changes that these steps produce. </p>\n\n<p>It is one of the dimensions of the<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gouv.fr\"> data.gouv.fr</a> portal: a world first in this genre, authorizing its users, administrations, citizens, researchers, to enter into a dialogue with the producer of the data, to share points of view not his/her own, to improve the data, to cross-reference it with others, even depositing data that is not the State&rsquo;s. </p>\n\n<p>With more than 1300 reuses one semester after opening the platform, it is clear that a living community was created, and that it took hold of this resource. </p>\n\n<h3>We believe in debate</h3>\n\n<p>We believe a lot in this debate, which is developing on our platform, on Twitter, on many &ldquo;hackathons&rdquo; that we organize, as well as within organizations. Even more so than on metadata. </p>\n\n<p>This is because I wanted to highlight the paradox of Evelyne Ruppert&rsquo;s position: after making the observation on the impossibility of transparency, and the impossibility of restoring confidence, she proposes to us a &ldquo;transparency on transparency&rdquo;, a &ldquo;metatransparency.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Without active communities, confident and caring, you can increase transparency to the second or third power, and nothing will happen. As always on the internet, what counts are the human communities that organize themselves thanks to these resources. </p>\n\n<p>France is highly conscious of the fact that sharing data should allow for the construction of genuine gestures of democratic exchange, to kindle the informed contribution of the citizen to public decisions. Opening data should lead to an opening of the public decision in itself. </p>\n\n<p>This is the meaning behind France&rsquo;s entry into the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\">Open Government Partnership </a>announced in May by the President. By joining this community of public innovators that <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.gouvernement.fr/gouvernement/la-france-elue-au-comite-directeur-d-opengovpart\">elected us to its steering committee</a> on August 4, France has chosen to build a partnership with people that know that open data takes all of its meaning in open government, and who work concretely in this direction. </p>\n\n<h3>A democracy of the actors</h3>\n\n<p>There are, however, other dimensions to open data not limited to the control of representative democracy. There is a dimension for empowerment which is curiously absent from this interview. To really understand this, you have to understand how much this movement is linked to the current <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://colin-verdier.com/le-logiciel-devore-le-monde-depuis-les-etats-unis/\">digital revolution</a>, and how much an impact it can have on the economy of innovation. </p>\n\n<p>We have entered a world where every ten years the power of computers is multiplied by thirty, and the cost is divided by the same number. Very recently, digital technology has opened in society an unimaginable power to act. </p>\n\n<p>Added to the existence of the internet, which allows citizens to be synchronized, to organize, and to cooperate, this revolution has brought us to a new world where the power of the many has become an essential political parameter. </p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, not everyone is equal before technology, as rightly emphasized by Evelyne Ruppert. Admittedly, the risk of a digital fracture is chronic. Admittedly, we shall see the appearance of new technocrats.</p>\n\n<p>But, the same applies to all democratic revolutions. [The events of] 1789 or 1830 did not equally distribute power to all French people. But it did associate more people to power. </p>\n\n<p>This prioritization of skills is not antidemocratic. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.henriverdier.com/2014/01/manipuler-les-foules-sentimentales-ou.html\">The multitude is not the masses</a>. It is a living body, moving, with its own dynamics and organisations. </p>\n\n<p>There are a multitude of skills. The social organization becomes multipolar. New elites appear, basing their legitimacy on immeasurable dimensions. Bloggers can hold their own against journalists. Collectives develop Linux, Wikipedia, or OpenStreetMap. Guardianship on the social web will allow for a new prioritization of information. </p>\n\n<p>To think of society without taking this reality into account is to confine oneself to a pre-digital vision. It&rsquo;s to give up on using this dynamic as a lever. </p>\n\n<h3>The &ldquo;contributions of the multitude&rdquo;</h3>\n\n<p>If<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gouv.fr\"> data.gouv.fr</a> was opened to contributions from the multitude, it&rsquo;s not to make it &ldquo;interactive.&rdquo; It is because the site strives to become a platform embodying a community of producers and users of data. </p>\n\n<p>This is because the State no longer has the monopoly on the capacity to create information of general interest. This is because OpenStreetMap, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://openmeteoforecast.org/wiki/Open_Meteo_Forecast/Fr\">OpenM\u00e9t\u00e9oForecast</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://fr.openfoodfacts.org/\">OpenFoodFacts</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WikiDB\">WikiDB</a>, but also <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/organization/celtipharm\">Celtipharm</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/organization/ufc-que-choisir\">Que Choisir ?</a>, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/organization/croix-rouge-francaise\">Red Cross</a>, and tomorrow perhaps even unions, associations, and think thanks, have something to say, something to share. </p>\n\n<p>Why split the community of producers and the reusers that work in a network?</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also the feeling of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.henriverdier.com/2014/06/letat-innovateur-radical.html\">new alliances</a> that we look for with civil society when we support the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kisskissbankbank.com/pioupiou\">winners of Dataconnexions</a> on Kiss Kiss Bank Bank, when we help out <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://forum.openstreetmap.fr/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1187\">project Bano</a>, when we develop research models such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.openfisca.fr/\">OpenFisca</a>\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, the State has a big role.<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gouv.fr\"> Data.gouv.fr</a> cleanly separates data from authorities created by the State holding itself liable on its sincerity, and data created by other acteurs that the State merely authenticates its identity if asked. But this difference does not stop cooperation. </p>\n\n<h3>The revolution of usages</h3>\n\n<p>Above all, what counts with Open Data is what we can do with it. It is this dimension that is at the basis of two others ambitions of Open Data: fuel for innovation and motivation for the efficiency of public action. This data is not only to &ldquo;watch the State.&rdquo; Far from it. It is material for the exercise of an active citizenry. It is material for creation. </p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, there are unfounded secrets, but there is a need for more Mediapart (<em>a web site containing information and opinion articles</em>) to update these. This is, however, not the primary mission of Open Data. The mission of Open Data is that there are loads of unused knowledge in our systems. </p>\n\n<p>Knowledge that comes to life and takes value when put into circulation. There aren&rsquo;t just little secrets in the State. There are also thousands of useful and passionate information resulting from the work of thousands of public servants, involving their professional knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>The geolocated and time-stamped map of road accidents used during the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://fr.okfn.org/2014/08/09/retour-sur-le-premier-hackathon-sur-les-donnees-du-ministere-de-linterieur/\">recent hackathon organized by OKFN and the Ministry of the Interior</a>, and that enabled <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2014/06/25/carte-presque-tous-les-accidents-route-2012-253113\">Rue89 to do a fantastic job</a>, is worth its weight in kilobits. The files of street names that fed so many developments. The statistics on pollutions, the funding of the map, weather data\u2026</p>\n\n<p>It is the story of &ldquo;<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/moneyball/\">Moneyball</a>,&rdquo; a cult movie for &ldquo;datascientists.&rdquo; There was something in the statistics of Major League Baseball (in the USA) to reconstruct the sport. There is something in data from the State that can reconstruct large areas of public action. The important thing is to render this data implementable so that new actors can take this data and ask new questions. </p>\n\n<p>It is a dimension that is frequently lost on non-coders: Open Data is not limited to revealing data. The aim of it is to be accessible, manipulable, implementable. This is why it opens up a universe of unforeseen reuses. </p>\n\n<p>We do not ask for raw data in the name of some sort of naturalism of data. We ask for raw data in order to have the most manipulable data possible, to get the most number of interpretations possible, and to facilitate more possible manipulations. </p>\n\n<p>This is what <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web\">Tim Berners-Lee wanted to say with &ldquo;raw data.&rdquo;</a> This is not a sociological premise: this is the claim of an engineer. Deep down, we do not understand Open Data as long as we do not understand the difference between information concealed in a 1459 page report from the Court of Auditors, and information replaced in a complete series in an easy-to-use spreadsheet.</p>\n\n<h3>The revolution of data</h3>\n\n<p>We have in fact entered a new world where: whole segments of reality are codified and thus become analyzable; an increasing number of individuals and entities would know how to get new uses from them; big data opens up epistemological perspectives whose limits we have yet to see. </p>\n\n<p>By sharing data under a licence that prevents it from being used for individual profit, one introduces a political dimension to this data revolution. One rebalances power, prevents monopolies, creates common goods. It is one of the forms of essential political action at this period of digital revolution. </p>\n\n<p>The question remains about the quality of the data, its pertinence, and its capacity to describe reality. You have to admit that human sciences has a long history with data.</p>\n\n<p>From <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phr%C3%A9nologie\">phrenology</a> to contemporary marketing, from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Arthur_de_Gobineau\">Gobineau Alexis Carrel</a>, from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI\">IQ</a> to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_%C3%A9motionnelle\">EQ</a>, they have often translated their prejudices into pseudo-knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>They are well placed to know the risk of using contestable ontologies, of selecting correlations presented as causalities, of hiding from politics under the appearance of objectivity (see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.blog.lemonde.fr/2014/06/25/statactivisme-comment-lutter-avec-les-nombres/\">Stat-Activism, how to fight against the numbers</a>), or of working on data that does not reflect the prejudices of its authors. </p>\n\n<p>We mentioned it above. It\u2019s not entirely the problem of Open Data, that demands the simple sharing of tools that the State uses for its missions.  </p>\n\n<p>But if we really want to talk about it, let&rsquo;s remember that not all data is of the same nature: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>the exact number of the prison population</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>the geolocation of hospitals</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>trains schedules</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>the exact number of professors or tax officers</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>the price of fuel</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>the zip codes of villages in France</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>weather forecasts</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>road alignments</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Certainly the data are intellectual constructions, but does not mean that they do not pose a big epistemological question. </p>\n\n<p>We need not be told every time about the difference between noumena and phenomena and the myth of the cave. There are factual information that citizens demand, and that we can share without erring on the side of caution. </p>\n\n<p>Other data need more interpretation and deserve more analysis. For example, since the work of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/fr/\">Stiglitz commission</a>, France is familiar with the problems posed by GDP. Why is the value creation of government employees only addressed through their payroll?</p>\n\n<p>It is true that a lot of data does not exactly say what it appears to say. In this case it is true that the more transparency on the choices regarding the construction of this data, the more precision on the implicit hypotheses are in order. </p>\n\n<p>But conversely, it must be highlighted that each one of this data responds to at least one question. The statistics on justice, for example: the social distribution of sentences is it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>the distribution of delinquency?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>the punishment strategies adopted by judges?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>the capacity to call on a good lawyer?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>or does it talk about the distribution of the forms of delinquency and the severity of the law depending on these forms?</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I do not know. But sure enough, the precise analysis of the conditions of the construction of this data allows one to understand it. One just has to ask the right questions on this data. </p>\n\n<p>By any standards, the world of Open Data appears to me to be more capable of asking these right questions than other social worlds, and notably the media. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Henri Verdier is currently the director of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://etalab.gouv.fr\">Etalab</a>, the French government\u2019s Open Data task force in charge of opening public data and development of the Open Data platform.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>This article originally published in French on **<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/2014/08/11/open-data-democratie-reponse-dhenri-verdier-m-data-gouvernement-254156\">Le Nouvel Observateur / Rue 8*9</a></em> \ntranslated by Andr\u00e9 Confiado of Five by Five, **<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.fivebyfive.paris\">www.fivebyfive.pari*s</a></p>\n\n<p><em>This text was motivated by the interview of British sociologist Evelyne Ruppert, which appeared on Rue89 last week.

The basic idea is that the initiatives you plan and carry out to support your organization&rsquo;s goals and objective need to be \u201caligned\u201d (i.e., supportive of or in line with) your organization\u2019s goals and objectives. </p>\n\n<p>What does &ldquo;alignment&rdquo; mean in practice? How do you measure whether or not your activities are aligned with your goals and objectives? And what does this mean when the concept is applied to open data programs?</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of the things to look for including a caveat about applying this term too loosely to open data programs.</p>\n\n<p>The basic conditions for determining whether any initiative (for example, a program, a project, a purchase, a reorganization, a new product, a new hiring initiative, etc.) is aligned with your organization\u2019s goals and objectives are the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>You know what your organization\u2019s goals and objectives are.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>You know how to measure whether these goals and objectives are being accomplished.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>You and your management agree that your open data program supports one or more of your organization\u2019s goals and objectives.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>You know how to measure the relationship between your open data program and accomplishments of your organization\u2019s goals and objectives.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Items one and two don&rsquo;t have anything to do directly with open data programs. They are the basis for ensuring that any program or initiative is aligned with what the parent organization is attempting to accomplish.</p>\n\n<p>If the organization is able to articulate its goals and objectives but can&rsquo;t measure their accomplishment you have your work cut out for you if you decide to take on both implementing an open data program as well as measuring its performance against the organization\u2019s strategic objectives. It\u2019s not impossible to do both but at minimum more executive buy-in and involvement \u2013 and resources - may be required.</p>\n\n<p>There are many ways to measure accomplishments. Program impact range from purely qualitative to rigorously quantitative. Don&rsquo;t think that benefits always need to be measured in dollars and cents for management to be convinced that a program delivers useful results. At minimum you will need convincing anecdotal evidence of positive impacts that management will understand and accept.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned a caveat concerning the ability to demonstrate alignment between an open data program and a sponsoring organization\u2019s goals and objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t assume that you can predict, much less measure, all the uses made of the data your open data program provides. It&rsquo;s in the nature of open data programs to make data available for planned as well as new, unanticipated, and innovative uses. This should not deter you from proposing an open data program but instead should cause you and your organization to rethink how your organization can support accomplishments of its goals and objectives, even among partners and users with whom you may not have worked in the past.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://www.dev/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[{"name":"North Carolina","slug":"north-carolina","level":"city","beta":true,"web_url":"http://www.dev/nodes/north-carolina"}]},"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://www.dev/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[{"name":"North Carolina","slug":"north-carolina","level":"city","beta":true,"web_url":"http://www.dev/nodes/north-carolina"}],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[{"title":"What Does the Term \u201cProgram Alignment\u201d Mean When Applied to Open Data Programs?","url":"http://www.balefireglobal.com/blog/alefireglobal.com/2014/08/what-does-term-program-alignment-mean.html"}]}]}
