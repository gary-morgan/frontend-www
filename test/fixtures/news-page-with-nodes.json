At that time, I had just started my masters studies at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/prospective-pg/msc/mit\">University of St Andrews</a> and stumbled upon a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhR0o0cXFs\">YouTube clip</a> of Gavin Starks, newly appointed CEO of the ODI. In a lightning talk he briefly outlined the ODI&rsquo;s research agenda and its general openness towards interested external researchers. A couple of months later, I was able to leave the Scottish countryside for four weeks to work as a research intern at the ODI offices in Shoreditch, London. There, suddenly thrown into the vibrant heart of European Open Data, I tried to answer my dissertation&rsquo;s research question: How have different stakeholders influenced the development of the British Open Data Ecosystem?</p>\n\n<p>My research question emerged from a variety of previous attempts to generalise on the strategies that have been used to implement and sustain Open Data initiatives. There are many different, but overlapping, guidelines. At the World Bank, for example, an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/open-government-data-toolkit\">Open Government Data Working Group has developed a Toolkit</a> to help governments launch their own initiatives. The United Nation&rsquo;s Public Administration Programme, in turn, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://workspace.unpan.org/sites/Internet/Documents/Guidenlines%20on%20OGDCE%20May17%202013.pdf\">maintains guidelines</a> on how to use Open Government Data for citizen engagement. Finally, the OECD published <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/open-government-data_5k46bj4f03s7-en\">a framework</a> on how to conduct further empirical analyses of Open Government Data initiatives. A common denominator found across these and similar reports is that the promises of economic prosperity and civic empowerment can only be achieved in a well-established network of different stakeholders. With my work at the ODI, I therefore developed a descriptive case study of the British Open Data ecosystem as one of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://census.okfn.org/G8/\">\u201cbest in class\u201d</a>. When I came to London I not only expected to answer my academic research question, but also hoped to design a subsequent and longitudinal analysis of an ecosystem&rsquo;s structural properties.</p>\n\n<p>My initial research contained a review of existing attempts to define what constitutes an Open Data ecosystem. On the one hand, I was looking for a model broad enough to include all relevant actors, while on the other hand this model had to be specific enough to be operational in my field research.</p>\n\n<p>I finally developed a framework based on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedKingdom/Local%20Assets/Documents/Market%20insights/Deloitte%20Analytics/uk-da-open-growth.pdf\">an assessment of Open Data in the UK</a> produced by Deloitte. Here the \u201ctraditional\u201d Open Data value chain \u2013 from supplier through intermediary to consumer \u2013 is enhanced with a shortcut, as well as a feedback-loop. To include stakeholders, which do not interact with the data directly but play a significant role in the maintenance of the ecosystem, I added ecosystem enablers to the model as a separate stakeholder class. This category pools actors (like investors, academics and policy makers) who seem quite heterogenous at first glance, but in fact all play their own role in the network of an Open Data ecosystem. </p>\n\n<p>During my time at the ODI I used this taxonomy as a checklist to guide my research. With semi-structured interviews as my main source of data, I made sure to engage with at least one representative from each stakeholder category. To cover the supply side, I met with representatives from the Cabinet Office, as a proxy for public data holding bodies. I spoke with several startups (which transform Open Data into products and services) about their roles as intermediaries, and I met with various data consumers during Open Data meetups around London. An interview with Martin Tisn\u00e9 from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.omidyar.com/\">Omidyar Network</a> helped me to understand the role of impact investors within the ecosystem and a long discussion with Rufus Pollock shed light on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge Foundation&rsquo;s</a> role in the last decade of Open Data implementation in the UK. During my time at the ODI I managed to conduct 15 interviews in total, which I turned into roughly 13,000 words of transcribed text that I subsequently coded and analysed. </p>\n\n<p>Together with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/fredsaunderson\">Fred Saunderson</a>, who conducted his <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-post-shifting-environments-at-the-odi\">masters research</a> on open participation at the ODI as well, I intend to publish the final results of my dissertation within the coming months. </p>\n\n<p>My time at the ODI sparked my interest in the underlying structures and organisational routines of Open Data ecosystems and demonstrated to me the demand of further research that exists in this field. To address this demand I recently moved to Berlin to begin my PhD research on municipal Open Data ecosystems at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/\">Free University</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in my previous or future research, you can follow my <a href=\"www.heimstaedt.com\">research blog</a> or contact me directly on <a href=\"&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#109;&#046;&#104;&#101;&#105;&#109;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#101;&#100;&#116;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;\">&#109;&#046;&#104;&#101;&#105;&#109;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#101;&#100;&#116;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.images.cdn.fotopedia.com/flickr-5625707813-original/Photography_Techniques/Depth_of_field/Shallow_focus/Research.jpg\" alt=\"Alt\" /></p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Max Heimst\u00e4dt","slug":"max-heimstadt","web_url":"http://theodi.org/max-heimstadt","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Max Heimst\u00e4dt","slug":"max-heimstadt","web_url":"http://theodi.org/max-heimstadt","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/entering-the-age-of-open-data-business.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/entering-the-age-of-open-data-business","slug":"entering-the-age-of-open-data-business","title":"2014:  Entering the age of open data business","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:43+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-10T09:56:10+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/how-make-business-case-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/guides/how-make-business-case-open-data","slug":"how-make-business-case-open-data","title":"How to make a business case for open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:40+01:00","created_at":"2013-02-21T09:32:10+00:00","tag_ids":["guide"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"ODI Commercial Director, Stuart Coleman, is featured in the Spring 2014 issue[ Data IQ magazine](http://www.dataiq.co.uk) giving his insight on the future of open data in business:\r\n","excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/1d/8c/531d8c7ff362be6c870000cb/square_SRC-ODIimage.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"attachment-531d8c7f1f986a3e26000022\" /></p>\n\n<p>ODI Commercial Director, Stuart Coleman, is featured in the Spring 2014 issue<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dataiq.co.uk\"> Data IQ magazine</a> giving his insight on the future of open data in business:</p>\n\n<p>2013 saw sustained industry hype about big data that also conflated and confused the domains of personal data and open data, all at a time when the debate over data privacy raged at a global level. Although there are<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/data-definitions\"> important differences between the three &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of data</a>, there is also a rich ecosystem of ideas, innovation and ultimately\nsocial and commercial opportunity emerging in the spaces where they overlap.</p>\n\n<p>But how do businesses make returns with open data? The answer begins by mining it! Consider Climate Corporation\u2019s massive disruption of the US farming insurance market and subsequent \u00a31bn exit at the end of last year. Its business began with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://e-pluribusunum.com/2013/10/03/digging-in-the-open-data-dirt-climate-corporation-finds-nearly-1-billion-in-acquisition/\">\u2018digging about in open data dirt\u2019</a> and convened the smartest Silicon Valley data scientists (co-incidentally exploiting the same <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://wit.io/posts/clojure-all-grown-up\">clojure</a> tech stack as our very own <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mastodonc.com/\">Mastodon C</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Surely other parts of the insurance industry are ripe for similar transformation? I would love to see open environmental, social and economic data combine with telematics data to help sort out the stale <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2012/oct/05/wheels-come-off-car-insurance-premiums-going-up\">mess</a> that UK car insurance premiums are in.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a space where personal data privacy could be really be debated. Imagine a dynamic monthly insurance premium fluctuating in line with risks assessed using open data sources and personal driving data - <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://telematicsnews.info/2013/03/04/41423_m4043/\">Citroen</a> is already looking at this. So open data is there to be used, for social, environmental and economic gains.</p>\n\n<p>The business case for publishing open data is gathering momentum. For example, our June 2013 research <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/\">Show me the money</a> (carried out in collaboration with the Bank of England) brought to the fore (and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8a03efee-ed3a-11e2-ad6e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2rih0H4Ta\">\nfront page of the FT</a>) a showcase example. Using anonymous aggregate customer data\nsourced from the three largest UK peer-to-peer lending businesses, we proved a healthy market has been developing throughout the downturn, serving the needs of consumers and small businesses at a time when traditional lenders are not.  </p>\n\n<p>For those businesses leading new financial services, open data offers a credible and highly defensible path to <em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2298979\">&lsquo;data intensive but prescriptively light&rsquo;</a></em> regulation, providing consumers and investors with a deeper level of transparency and an opportunity to invest with greater confidence. Open data applied more broadly in finance has huge potential to help businesses keep nimble, honest and highly competitive. Let\u2019s hope that 2014 sees the growth of more open finance and raises the transparency bar.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/\">\nShow me the Money</a> is an example of how greater openness might deliver competitive advantage in one sector but there are multiple reasons why for profit businesses can and should publish open data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Openly outsourcing research and development: a unique, fast and inexpensive way to get your hands on expert outside help.<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kaggle.com/\"> Kaggle</a> is using this approach in data science to investigate information challenges and opportunities. Look to reward and engage people for finding opportunities and errors. (Not everyone has a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/microsoft-rewards-100000-to-hacker-for-internet-explorer-bug-issues-update-429743\">$100,000</a> prize fund like Microsoft, but incentives work on a smaller scale too!).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open data procurement: as Nike opened up their supply chain data, their reputation improved and suppliers became more competitive on price and quality. In the same way that governments open data, businesses could open up their spending data. There would be no need to name the suppliers but the market could use the data freely to compete.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open data product data: publishing product information as open data can help to extend and better syndicate the reach of products and services making it easier for partners and customers to embed, link to and curate company data.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open data reputation: publishing frequent and relevant data on a company\u2019s business activities helps to prove it is serious about being a better citizen.  </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>2014 will be a year when more big businesses embrace openness. The question they will need to address is not whether they should publish open data but how and when. I look forward to helping them find the answers!</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Stuart Coleman is Commercial Director of the ODI.

Depending on your point of view, highlighting CSV as a format may seem a bit crazy. After all, it&rsquo;s a basic data format that&rsquo;s widely used and deployed so it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that any work needs to be done with it. But it is also the cause of a lot of pain because of inconsistencies in how it is created: CSVs generated from standard spreadsheets and databases as a matter of course use variable encodings, variable quoting of special characters, and variable line endings.</p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of published open data is tabular; over 90% of the data published on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\">data.gov.uk</a> is tabular data. When data is in a consistent tabular form, you can do all sorts of things with it. Web applications such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ckan.org/\">CKAN</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.socrata.com/\">Socrata</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.google.com/drive/apps.html#fusiontables\">Google Fusion Tables</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.junar.com/\">Junar</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://enigma.io/\">enigma</a> and many others provide mechanisms to view the tabular data that they store in flexible ways: as tables, as graphs, as heatmaps. But they rely on the fact that they are storing the data themselves: they know it is in a consistent format, they know the types of values in different columns, they know what the codes within the data means.</p>\n\n<p>For tabular data to be part of the web, we need to separate where data is stored from how it can be viewed and processed. We should be able to open a file of tabular data in our browsers, and see it displayed as a table. We should be able to use a <code>&lt;heatmap src=\"population.csv\"&gt;</code> element in our web pages and view it as an interactive map. We should be able to search for data on the web using a search engine that looks inside the data itself to work out what it&rsquo;s about.</p>\n\n<p>More, I believe that tabular data needs to live not just <strong>on</strong> the web but <strong>in</strong> the web. We should be able to link from documents to cells within tabular data, from a cell in one table to a cell in another, and from tabular data to all the other rich information that exists on the web.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, tabular data on the web is published in one of two ways:</p>\n\n<p>First, tabular data is published as <strong>Excel spreadsheets</strong> (or spreadsheets using another tool, but it&rsquo;s most usually Excel). These provide a huge amount of flexibility for providing metadata about the dataset such as where it comes from, further details about what columns actually mean, and notes about the values in particular cells. Take a look at this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rsi/retail-sales/december-2013/rft-retail-sales-index-categories-and-their-percentage-weights-in-2012.xls\">spreadsheet from the Office of National Statistics</a> in the UK, and you&rsquo;ll see these features being used to the fullest extent. For statisticians \u2014 indeed anyone who cares about the responsible publication of data \u2014 the ability to provide this context, aiming to add explanation and avoid misinterpretation, is very important.</p>\n\n<p>For developers, using Excel for data is problematic because the data is encoded within it in an unreliable and unpredictable way. It&rsquo;s not desperately difficult, with a bit of work, to put something together that pulls data out of a single Excel file. But if that tool has to also work with similar Excel files, perhaps published in a series, each of which will have their formatting quirks, it becomes terribly time-consuming. Creating generic tools that can extract data from any Excel file is completely impractical.</p>\n\n<p>Second, tabular data is published as <strong>CSV files</strong> (or possibly tab-separated or colon-separated files). These are usually relatively easy for developers to process, at least so long as a consistent encoding is used and correct quoting of values and escaping of characters has been carried out. But CSV files are desperately poor at providing contextual information that can aid in automated processing of the data that they hold, or even in informing developers about how they should be interpreted. Publishers who want to provide that context either package CSVs up with human-readable documentation (in zips arranged in non-standard ways), or assume that the CSV has been retrieved via a particular explanatory web page.</p>\n\n<p>CSV is insufficient for tabular data on the web, with independent generic viewers, because it lacks this context. Not knowing which columns contain numeric data makes it impossible to sort correctly. Not knowing which values are links makes it impossible to connect the data into the web. Crucially, from an open data perspective, this lack of expressivity means there is no obvious way to express the licence under which CSV data can be reused.</p>\n\n<p>There is a sweet spot between developer-friendly, unexpressive CSV and developer-hostile, expressive Excel.</p>\n\n<p>Formats such as the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/simple-data-format/\">Simple Data Format (SDF) developed by OKF</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/public-data/\">DataSet Publishing Language (DSPL) developed by Google</a> sit in that sweet spot. They both define how to package CSV files with a metadata description (in JSON or in XML) that describes the content of the CSV files, and how they relate to each other.</p>\n\n<p>Formalising and standardising the sweet spot is the role of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page\">CSV on the Web Working Group</a> which I am co-chairing with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://danbri.org/\">Dan Brickley</a>. If you work on tools that either consume or produce tabular data, you should at least follow the work of the group by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://lists.w3.org/#public-csv-wg\">subscribing to the mailing list</a>. If you work for a company that is a W3C member, please consider <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/68238/join\">joining the group</a>. If you support this standardisation effort and aren&rsquo;t a W3C member, please consider <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/join\">joining the W3C</a> so you can join the group, or <a href=\"&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#103;&#114;&#111;&#117;&#112;&#045;&#099;&#115;&#118;&#045;&#099;&#104;&#097;&#105;&#114;&#115;&#064;&#119;&#051;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;\">email us</a> to be considered as an independent expert.</p>\n\n<p>If we&rsquo;re successful, I expect to see implementation of parsers/importers for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.r-project.org/\">R</a>, NoSQL databases such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/\">MongoDB</a>, SQL databases, and triplestores.

It is the Postcode Address File (PAF) \u2013 the definitive record of the official postal address and postcode for 28m UK addresses. Companies need this data to drive business and domestic services, logistics, customer relationships and advertising.\u0002In an age of emerging mobile computing and location-based services it is key data for further innovation.\u0002In addition, this data is essential to government to carry out almost all its functions from the census to tax collecting, welfare, health and blue light services. Addressing is no longer about delivering letters: it is now a cornerstone of the new, much larger, digital economy.</p>\n\n<p>Under the Postal Services Act 2000, the Royal Mail have \u201cstewardship for the time being\u201d of this national asset. This national asset is very expensive to use, inflexibly provided and licensed in a complex way.\u0002Restrictive licenses for the PAF lead to restrictive licenses for a range of datasets that incorporate addresses. As a monopoly provider, there has been no transparency or real pressure to reduce costs and improve technology.\u0002Despite this, some larger businesses and government departments do navigate the onerous licence conditions and pay the costs. But for too many, particularly SMEs and data entrepreneurs, the costs and restrictive conditions put it out of reach.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/docs/pdfs/report/11_2012/summary.pdf\">Research by Deloitte and others</a>\u0002has shown that restrictive licensing and charging for public datasets like this strongly suppresses demand - and releasing such data for free increases usage by factors of between 10 and 100. In Denmark the Government made its address file free in 2002; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.adresse-info.dk/Portals/2/Benefit/Value_Assessment_Danish_Address_Data_UK_2010-07-07b.pdf\">it has calculated a</a> 30 to 1 ratio of direct financial benefits to cost.\u0002In the Netherlands, the government sold their equivalent of the PAF to the new private owner of their Post Office; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/library/open-data-user-group-postcode-ownership-international-examples\">they had to fight and win</a> a costly court case to secure\u0002a national address and buildings register that others could reuse.</p>\n\n<p>The lack of an Open Data PAF is the single biggest complaint from open-data entrepreneurs, and the Government\u2019s own Open Data User Group. The Government has promised a \u201cRight to Data\u201d: PAF is the single most requested data set. Royal Mail privatization presents an opportunity to maximize the economic advantage of the PAF dataset. Ideally this would have happened by taking it out of the hands of Royal Mail and making it open data.</p>\n\n<p>We now learn that it is to remain in Royal Mail ownership. It is therefore essential that Ofcom, who have the statutory right to determine price and licensing policy of the PAF, find the means to ensure that this data is made available under an Open Licence and at marginal cost. Unless it is regulated appropriately, it will continue to be run to maximize the financial return from a monopoly data asset at the cost of overall national economic growth and business productivity. Unless it is regulated appropriately, the Royal Mail will continue to extract a monopoly rent from other businesses. Unless it is regulated appropriately, the Royal Mail will continue to use inefficient and costly methods to maintain the PAF. Unless it\u0002is regulated appropriately it will inhibit competition and innovation to the detriment of the wider UK economy.\u0002\nThe Postcode Address File is part of the UK\u2019s national information infrastructure and it should be made available as open data. All the evidence is that this will drive widespread public and private value creation and growth. It will promote a competitive and innovative digital economy through a new generation of data-driven companies and services in the UK. It will provide the benefits of open innovation to the Royal Mail itself as others build services and capability, as others improve the quality of the data that Royal Mail itself relies on.</p>\n\n<p><em>Nigel Shadbolt is the co-founder and Chairman of the ODI</em></p>\n\n<p>\u0002</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Sir Nigel Shadbolt","slug":"nigel-shadbolt","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/nigel-shadbolt","tag_ids":["team","board"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Sir Nigel Shadbolt","slug":"nigel-shadbolt","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/nigel-shadbolt","tag_ids":["team","board"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/a-bigger-and-better-introducing-our-newest-members.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/a-bigger-and-better-introducing-our-newest-members","slug":"a-bigger-and-better-introducing-our-newest-members","title":"A bigger and better us - introducing our two newest members","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:34+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-24T18:56:15+01:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/member-blog-post-transition-towards-transparency.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/member-blog-post-transition-towards-transparency","slug":"member-blog-post-transition-towards-transparency","title":"Member blog post: The transition towards transparency","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:04+01:00","created_at":"2013-09-26T22:31:33+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data","slug":"member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data","title":"Member blog: Creating fruitful partnerships with open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:02+01:00","created_at":"2013-09-10T10:52:18+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Ahead of our Summit in London on 29 October, we\u2019re delighted to be announcing two new members; London-based RateSetter, and Seattle\u2019s Socrata.

They take our membership to 45, and are testimony to the international appeal and multi-sector influence that we are forging.</p>\n\n<h3>RateSetter</h3>\n\n<p>We first collaborated with RateSetter earlier this year, when they helped us conduct <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/peer-peer-lending-businesses-lead-way-opening-financial-data\">research</a> into the size and shape of the UK peer-to-peer lending market. Despite forming only three years ago, RateSetter is already a leading operator in that space, having matched over \u00a3120m in loans in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>It is not simply that they empower millions of ordinary people that draws us together; but rather the principles and tools that facilitate that. Critical of banks and regulators for their monopoly on financial information and control of risk, RateSetter collects and makes data available that helps individuals to lend and borrow to each other.</p>\n\n<p>By harnessing open data, RateSetter lets people take responsibility for their own financial risks and rewards; borrowers are suddenly able to say how much they need and are willing to pay, and lenders say how much they want in return of their investment. The result is a transparent, informed and connected financial community, quite unreflective of the traditional closed banking system.</p>\n\n<p>Rhydian Lewis, founder and CEO of RateSetter, said:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to be working with the ODI to push the boundaries of what open data can achieve. We believe openness and transparency is fundamental in finance and as such sits at the heart of who we are as a company - from our live information feeds, to the way we conduct our credit checks. Data sharing can go beyond us as an individual company, it has the potential to benefit society as a whole, even to preventing another financial crisis. Looking down the list of other members, it\u2019s exciting to be part of this wider data sharing movement, and we are proud to be playing our part&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<h3>Socrata</h3>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re also delighted to be welcoming Socrata, a Seattle based cloud solutions company who help governments democratise their data. Their objective, much like our own, is to build a more transparent society, by giving citizens and developers access to information, and so bring facts into everyday decision making. Since launching in 2007, Socrata has worked with local governments in Chicago, San Francisco, New York City, Austin, Maryland, Illinois, and with public organisations such as the World Bank, Medicare, Data.gov and EnergyStar, to drive their transparency agendas by making their data more easily available.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps their best known resources, GovStat helps policy makers to openly communicate the objectives and impact of government economic projects; while the Socrata Open Data API (SODA) allows developers to repurpose government data for use in web and mobile apps. Apps created with Socrata\u2019s APIs include a real-time notice of parking violations for drivers in Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin Merritt, founder and CEO of Socrata, comments:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our membership of the ODI is synergistic with everything we are trying to achieve as a company. Governments of all shapes and sizes now recognise that data and information is not just a matter of compliance, but a powerful communication tool to empower citizens. We&rsquo;re looking forward to being an active member of the ODI as we work collaboratively with other members, and on an international scale, to continue to grow the impact of open data around the world.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The ODI&rsquo;s Commercial Director, Stuart Coleman said:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted to have attracted RateSetter and Socrata to the ODI, which takes our membership to 45 companies. These are two very different businesses that share a vision of supporting and using open data and open approaches. RateSetter provide more transparency and additional value to consumers. Socrata enable governments and citizens to more effectively interact by making it easier to publish, access and consume open data. Together they are excellent additions to the ODI membership programme.&rdquo;</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/healthy-start-hackathons-odi.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/healthy-start-hackathons-odi","slug":"healthy-start-hackathons-odi","title":"A healthy start for Hackathons at the ODI","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:08+01:00","created_at":"2012-11-05T18:16:24+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"New fitness apps and projects that find savings in NHS prescription data were amongst the winners at the Hack4Health event this weekend.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p><em>New fitness apps and projects that find savings in NHS prescription data were amongst the winners at the Hack4Health event this weekend.</em></p>\n\n<p>More than 40 health and fitness professionals, academics and developers came together at The Open Data Institute to work with new datasets including ones provided by The Care Quality Commission, NHS Choices, Spogo and Data.gov.uk.</p>\n\n<h3>Friday evening event</h3>\n\n<p>The hackathon was jointly organised by The ODI, Coadec, Healthbox, NHS Information Centre, Cabinet Office, the Open Knowledge Foundation and NHS Hackday.

Elegant and imaginative uses of data can make sure that decisions by professionals are transparent, accountable, and driven by evidence, as demonstrated by the work done on prescribing data this weekend. But the same kind of work can also ensure that healthy decisions are easy, as the tennis matchmaker shows\u201d. Nigel Shadbolt added:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe great thing about a hack day is that it brings together innovators, developers and people with great ideas to focus on the data itself. The other thing it brings is a sense of common purpose \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of networking between the various ideas. That happens when you bring people in to close proximity together over 2 or 3 days. Great ideas are born\u201d <em>The winning team, Go-Hit-It-Off will be guest blogging on this site soon and if you would like to take part in the next ODI hackathon see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/events\">ODI Events</a></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Photos: Brendan Lea</em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"David Tarrant","slug":"david-tarrant","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/david-tarrant","tag_ids":["team","commercial"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"David Tarrant","slug":"david-tarrant","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/david-tarrant","tag_ids":["team","commercial"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/long-held-ambition-realised-odi-opens-officially.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/long-held-ambition-realised-odi-opens-officially","slug":"long-held-ambition-realised-odi-opens-officially","title":"A long-held ambition realised as the ODI opens officially","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:17+01:00","created_at":"2012-12-04T11:22:19+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"Today is the official launch of the ODI and we\u2019ll be welcoming both Francis Maude and David Willetts as our guests.

Support at the very highest levels of Government has been crucial not just for the ODI but for the success of open data efforts in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Tim Berners-Lee and I were appointed by the previous Government to begin a process of releasing government public data. We had our portal data.gov.uk running in 5 months with its first data sets. Beta sites and agile development, open source and open innovation - these were new concepts to government.</p>\n\n<p>Tim and I were asked to join others on the Transparency Board and to continue advising on Open Data. The commitment to open data, featured large in the Conservative Party\u2019s Technology Manifesto and in this Governments work \u2013 with real and substantial achievements in policy and practice.</p>\n\n<p>So the UK has been fortunate to have Governments from across the political divide that have understood the importance of open data. I make this point because open data must not, should not and so far has not been a matter of partisan politics. The development of open data in the UK is something all the major parties can be proud of.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Benefits for the Public</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have said before that open data is a public good; it is a public good just like clean air and clean water. \u0002And many benefits flow from this public good.</p>\n\n<p>For example, transparency and accountability. When the infection rates in our hospitals are published as open data, this data holds those institutions accountable. Those that perform poorly have to look to their laurels.</p>\n\n<p>Since the data on infection rates were published there has been an 85% decrease in patients infected with MRSA. And it costs \u00a39000 to treat a patient wit MRSA, so open data is making hospitals more efficient, it is saving money. We can\u2019t lay all of this improvement at the door of open data but when people can see the difference between the best and the worst it drives a sharing of best practice; people look to understand the differences and strive to do better. Open data of this sort is also a social good in and of itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Engaging Open Data</strong></p>\n\n<p>Open data can lead to engagement and participation. Every month police forces in England and Wales publish their reported crime data, by type and location. The first month following the publication of this data saw significant increases in calls to the police offering additional information on those reported crimes.</p>\n\n<p>Open data can create economic value.. Just how much may not yet be exactly quantifiable but all the evidence is in one direction. From insurance to intelligent procurement, transport to health, companies are beginning to sense the economic opportunity. The shape of this new market is outlined in the Deloitte research on which we collaborated. Economic value creation is one of the main reasons we are here today.</p>\n\n<p>But there is no one reason to do open data, there are many. There is no one benefit, there are many. \u0002This is why it is important to maintain and extend the publication of open data. This why the Government\u2019s continued commitment to open data is so important - and it is why the ODI is so important.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Beginnings</strong></p>\n\n<p>The ODI had its genesis in conversations Tim and I had with No 10. He and I believed that there was the opportunity to create a world class centre to help pull through the UK\u2019s expertise and leadership in this area. The Chancellor announced funding in last year\u2019s Autumn Statement for an Open Data Institute to be established in Shoreditch with Government providing \u00a310m over 5 years via the Technology Strategy Board(TSB), and the ODI to raise matched funding over this same time period.</p>\n\n<p>The TSB needed a detailed plan before they could enter in to an agreement. A good part of my life from December through April was spent creating a blueprint for the ODI and writing that plan. I\u2019d like to express now my thanks to those who helped and gave advice \u2013 Tim Kelsey, Pete Lawrence and Olivia Burman from the Cabinet Office; Iain Gray, David Bott and Hadley Beaman from the TSB \u2013 and many others.</p>\n\n<p>When the plan was approved all we had to do was set up the ODI. this was a brand new entity. We had a plan but no premises, no people and no trading history. Yet we had the right idea.</p>\n\n<p>And here we owe a debt of gratitude to the University of Southampton and its Vice Chancellor Don Nutbeam. They provided access to their estates and legal teams. They paid for a project manager before the funding agreement was in place. They did this because they believed in open data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Project Management</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Project Manager I hired to help me is someone the ODI owes a particular debt of thanks to. Tim Organ was magnificent. We spent many hours looking for the right place. We believed that being in the right place and in the right space were essential. We wanted an open and collaborative feel. A world without walls but with private space. We believe we have a special space here in Clifton Street.</p>\n\n<p>As the space developed we needed to find the right management team. We have in Gavin Starks, Jeni Tennison and Stuart Coulman \u0002a management team with flair, energy, talent and ambition. As the ODI has expanded and our team grown so too has my excitement about what we might achieve.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Catalysing a New Industry</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are in fact fashioning a new infrastructure \u2013 a data infrastructure every bit as essential as the servers, the fibre, the radio spectrum and the mobile networks that store and distribute it.</p>\n\n<p>Open data on health, transport, crime, and the environment. Open data on companies, contracts, spending and procurement. Open data on the energy we produce and consume. Open geospatial data and open demographic data. All of this has value when it becomes actionable information, when it delivers a service that a citizen can use or a consumer wants. Data has value when it enables a business or department to improve itself, its products and processes.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the value of open data is how it adds value to other kinds of data; open and closed, personal and non-personal. I Chair the midata programme for BIS which is all about giving each of us access to the data that companies collect when we interact with them. Recently we organised a weekend hackathon at the ODI exploring the opportunities of a midata world.</p>\n\n<p>It must be right that this access extends to the data that Government holds about us (our tax and welfare data, education and health data) by putting citizens at the heart of their own information we could effect a transformation,\u0002one that holds the key to the effective delivery of government services to citizens.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Training</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the ODI we are committed to training the next generation of public technologists.

Even if they are aware of this they likely don\u2019t know how to best publish and release the data in a way which is useful to others.  </p>\n\n<p>During the session I talked about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mastodonc.com/\">Mastodon C</a>, a start-up company incubated at the ODI, which identified that <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21567980-how-scrutiny-freely-available-data-might-save-nhs-money-beggar-thy-neighbour\">\u00a3200m could be saved by the NHS each year</a>, on just one drug type (statins), simply by prescribing the non-branded versions. This was determined in just eight weeks by analysing open data, and is just one example of how open government data can be released and used responsibly to help a business grow and to show the government where it can save money.</p>\n\n<p>More and more data is being released as organisations recognise the value of doing this, but there is a way to go. </p>\n\n<p>Just one example: there are 260 million companies around the world all creating their own data about their emissions, material use etc. Imagine what could be achieved if they released their environmental data in a common machine readable format. Such data could both enable organisations to understand their own environmental impact and behaviour, and help us to see trends and collective impacts and behaviours across organisations and businesses.</p>\n\n<p>What makes this challenging, however, is the absence of a universal framework or format for environmental data, or indeed legislation to encourage companies to open up access to this kind of data. Reporting schemes like the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdp.net/en-US/Pages/HomePage.aspx\">Carbon Disclosure Project </a> help - legislation about how, when and in what format industry should make data available would go a lot further.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The skills needed to supply, disseminate and mine the data are in short supply</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many people get excited about big data and the patterns they see in it, but can\u2019t or don\u2019t have the experience to do more with it. A recent <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/21a6e7d8-b479-11e3-a09a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2yqc1UgxG\">article</a> in the Financial Times goes into this in more detail and is worth a read: it summarises that it is imperative to combine big data technical and scientific skills with domain expertise else risk missing the real truth in the data.</p>\n\n<p>The same can be seen across organisations where the skills needed to handle, use and release data can vary dramatically. A straw poll at one of the tables I joined showed that only a handful of the businesses present had dedicated data teams.</p>\n\n<p>Developing and increasing data skills in businesses will help to plug this gap.</p>\n\n<p>The Royal Statistical Society recently launched<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentChapterView.asp?chapter=25\"> Get Stats</a>, a new programme to enable and encourage the responsible use of numbers. I\u2019d highly recommend it for anyone looking for the basics in how to use numbers. And the ODI has a training arm delivering both<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/courses\"> introductory and more advanced courses</a> on open data, and free <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures\">lunchtime lectures</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Different data formats are needed for different audiences and different use cases</strong></p>\n\n<p>Complex data sets will work for some people but, where there is a wider need (or even greater good) to communicate, different formats can be deployed to help people to understand and use data.</p>\n\n<p>For example, mainstream audiences may find data visualisations / infographics easier to engage with. This<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/when-sea-levels-attack-2/\"> visualisation</a> of the impact of rising sea levels on world cities is a good example of how data can be turned into interesting and understandable content.</p>\n\n<p>Engaging the public in gathering data \u2013 crowdsourcing \u2013 can also be a powerful tool, not only helping to get them interested and involved but also generating new data and insights not available within businesses. Cancer Research has just launched a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-02/04/genes-in-space-cancer-research\">campaign</a> to do this.</p>\n\n<p>The session wrapped up with a few final thoughts. I\u2019ll leave one of them with you: The original renaissance took around 300 years, can we afford for the data renaissance to take that long?</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"ODI blog post: Stuart Coleman","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Stuart Coleman","slug":"stuart-coleman","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-coleman","tag_ids":["executive","commercial","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Stuart Coleman","slug":"stuart-coleman","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-coleman","tag_ids":["executive","commercial","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/adapting-git-simple-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/adapting-git-simple-data","slug":"adapting-git-simple-data","title":"Adapting Git for simple data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:41+01:00","created_at":"2013-08-19T15:10:22+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"A while ago I wrote about using Git for data publishing, and talked about how the tools and particularly the workflow used by many open source projects could revolutionise how we create, publish, and collaborate on open data.

Data is complex stuff; it may be that we need new tools to handle it, like <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://rawbase.github.io/\">R&amp;Wbase</a>, or Max Ogden&rsquo;s new <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/maxogden/dat\">dat</a> project. However, I tend to side with those who reckon we can do a lot more with the tools we already have (not that there are <em>sides</em> \u0002or anything, we&rsquo;re all friends). As <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ben.balter.com/2013/07/01/technologys-the-easy-part/\">Ben Balter wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We should be co-opting proven tools already in the hands of public servants and making it so ridiculously straightforward for government agencies to distribute information and build collaborative communities around shared problems that it would be criminal for them not to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;ve continued hacking away at the tools we already have, trying to make them work for data. Not\u0002 <em>all</em> \u0002data, but certainly for small, simple datasets, particularly data in simple CSV format. At this point, we&rsquo;re going to dive into a few Git internals, so apologies if \u0002it gets a little \u0002technical from here on in.</p>\n\n<h2>Making Git work with CSVs</h2>\n\n<p>The main problem with using git for things like CSV formats comes because it stores changes line-by-line. If you compare two files, you can see the lines that have changed. That&rsquo;s great if your information is line-oriented, but it falls over for CSV. Row operations are OK, but column operations hit every single line, making git&rsquo;s built-in comparisons useless.</p>\n\n<p>What can we do about this? As a user, I don&rsquo;t care how efficiently the change is stored internally, as long as I can understand what&rsquo;s happening, so this really just comes down to presentation.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a sample bit of data, and let&rsquo;s look at the one bit of software everyone using git has - the command-line interface. Here&rsquo;s a diff of a change I made:</p>\n\n<p><code>git diff data.csv</code></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/diff%2Dcolour.png\" alt=\"git diff\" /></p>\n\n<p>So far, so impenetrable. I think I can see that there&rsquo;s a new column in there, but if anything else changed, I&rsquo;m certainly not going to spot it in amongst all that.</p>\n\n<p>However, git allows us to customise how we show diffs for different formats. Using <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/ch7-2.html\">git attributes</a>, we can tell git how we want it to handle CSV files, including customising\u0002 various things about how diffs are performed.</p>\n\n<p>We also need to use\u0002 git&rsquo;s\u0002&ndash;word-diff option, which is used to show differences within lines in text by splitting along word boundaries. If we tell git that we want to use the word-diff, we can then customise how the line is split up for CSV files in particular.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s try something stupid first, and say that\u0002 <em>every character</em> \u0002should be treated as a separate word when doing word-diffs. We add a csv file type to a shared git attributes file, and add a diff filter for CSV that specifies a simple word regex that will match any character:</p>\n\n<pre><code># ~/.config/git/attributes\n*.csv\tdiff=csv\n\n# ~/.gitconfig\n[diff \"csv\"]\n\twordRegex = .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>git diff --word-diff data.csv</code></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/wordRegexDot.png\" alt=\"wordRegex=.\" /></p>\n\n<p>This is already a\u0002 <em>lot</em> \u0002better. We can see what&rsquo;s going on at least. Not only have I added a column, but I&rsquo;ve added a row for Mercury, and fixed some formatting near the end. I really should learn to split up my commits better.</p>\n\n<p>However good this looks, it&rsquo;s not right. The diff picks up the wrong bits as part of a change sometimes, like the &lsquo;a&rsquo; in the first line, or the quotes at the start of the Mercury line. Let&rsquo;s make it a bit more CSV-specific.</p>\n\n<pre><code># ~/.gitconfig\n[diff \"csv\"]\n\twordRegex = [^,\\n]+[,\\n]|[,]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The regular expression here took a bit of working out, so I won&rsquo;t explain character by character, but suffice it to say that it tells git that &lsquo;words&rsquo; are things that end in commas or newlines. That turns out to do exactly what we want:</p>\n\n<p><code>git diff --word-diff data.csv</code></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/csv%2Ddiff.png\" alt=\"CSV diff\" /></p>\n\n<p>Not only do the diffs now line up to fields, we get entire field changes being shown, as in the last two lines.</p>\n\n<p>This is great, and means that for people who use the command line, CSV diffs are now a possibility. Unfortunately, this has to be configured per-user; there is no way to do it for a repository. With that in mind, I&rsquo;ve tried to make the configuration as easy as possible, and created a script called <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csv-my-git\">csv-my-git</a> \u0002which sets this up for you on your local machine. You can just enter the following command in a terminal, and it will sort it all out for you:</p>\n\n<pre><code>curl -L http://theodi.github.io/csv-my-git/install.sh | bash\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It sets up the format, and also adds a <code>git diffcsv</code> alias for you to simplify the command line a bit (as suggested by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/samuelleach\">Sam Leach</a>).</p>\n\n<p>There are some obvious problems here - firstly,\u0002 it assumes a very simple CSV format. If you use tabs to separate your fields, then this will currently not work. However, it&rsquo;s open source, so improvements and contributions are welcome! Secondly, you have to include the &ndash;word-diff option (or use diffcsv) every time; \u0002if anyone knows how to make word-diff the \u0002<em>default</em> \u0002for a particular file type, I will buy you a decent number of drinks.</p>\n\n<h2>Customising Web UIs</h2>\n\n<p>The command line is all very well; it lets us prove that this is \u0002<em>possible</em>, but even I, as a seasoned developer, rarely use git on the command line. Let&rsquo;s make something a bit more usable.</p>\n\n<p>As the problem is one of display and tooling, we don&rsquo;t need to fundamentally change git. We just need to change the tools; and the big tool that we want this to work with is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://github.com\">GitHub</a>. If we could get proper CSV support into GitHub&rsquo;s commit views and pull requests, well, that would be a thing of beauty.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately for us, GitHub isn&rsquo;t open source, so we can&rsquo;t just change it. Fortunately, however, there is an open source github-alike called <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gitlab.org/\">Gitlab</a>, which we \u0002<em>can</em> \u0002change. Yay open source!</p>\n\n<p>Gitlab&rsquo;s default view for CSV is to show it as a text diff, very similar to the first command-line one above. Not useful. However, it&rsquo;s incredibly easy to configure. We add a method to detect if a file is a CSV, and then we can write a CSV-specific view. Here&rsquo;s a view showing the contents of a CSV file in a table, rather than just as text, in Gitlab:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/csv_table.png\" alt=\"Gitlab CSV view\" /></p>\n\n<p>Nice and simple, but proving we can do it.</p>\n\n<p>Next thing is to add diff support. Now, showing diffs in tabular format, that&rsquo;s a non-trivial UI challenge, I thought to myself. Then up popped <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2013/08/08/diffing-and-patching-data.html\">an\u0002 <em>incredibly</em> \u0002well-timed post</a> on the OKFN Labs blog by Paul Fitzpatrick about his <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://paulfitz.github.io/coopyhx/\">coopyhx</a> project, which does <em>exactly</em>\u0002 this. It even has a bit of Javascript which, given two tables, shows the diff in a really useful way.</p>\n\n<p>So, back to Gitlab; all we need is the old file, the new file, a bit of coopyhx javascript, and suddenly we have a diff view of CSV files right there in your commit logs and pull requests:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/csv_gitlab_diff.png\" alt=\"CSV diff in Gitlab\" /></p>\n\n<p>This is, quite simply, spectacular. If we could get GitHub to add something like this, I think around 95% of our data sharing and collboration work would get easier. Failing that, we just need someone to host a Gitlab instance with CSV support!</p>\n\n<p>The Gitlab work is still very much a work in progress, but you can get the code from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/gitlabhq/tree/csv-view\">csv-view branch of our gitlab fork</a>, and also <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/pull/4810\">weigh in on the Gitlab\u0002 pull request</a>. As with the git configuration above, it needs to be more robust and handle other formats, but I think this is a really good step towards solving some of problems we have with git for data, and proving that we really\u0002 <em>can</em> \u0002do a hell of a lot with the tools we already have.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few days after this was published, GitHub released an update that shows <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/blog/1601-see-your-csvs\">CSVs in their web interface</a>. It includes linking of lines, search, filtering, and is really really nice. I think that while this is a big step forward, the really useful stuff comes when we can properly use the fork / pull request model with data, and diffs are essential for that. Unfortunately, \u0002CSV diffs are still shown in the traditional line-at-a-time way. You never know though, maybe it won&rsquo;t be long.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/letter-to-santa-2013.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/letter-to-santa-2013","slug":"letter-to-santa-2013","title":"An open letter to Santa and a vision of open data for 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:45+01:00","created_at":"2013-12-20T20:44:03+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"This was my contribution to the Open Data Christmas Friday Lunchtime Lecture.

Like the great technical team here! Oh, and that lovely price paid data from Land Registry. And obviously the lego. I&rsquo;m very grateful.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve tried very hard, but I know that I haven&rsquo;t been <em>entirely</em> good this year.</p>\n\n<p>There was that time that I used some data that I shouldn&rsquo;t have. The terms and conditions said things like &lsquo;personal use only&rsquo; and &lsquo;must not be changed in any way&rsquo; and &lsquo;you must not download anything from this website&rsquo;. But the page I got it from said &lsquo;open data&rsquo; and it was just a link on the page and &hellip; honestly, the click was accidental and then, since it was on my computer anyway, and it was <em>really</em> useful&hellip; I felt bad afterwards. And I don&rsquo;t think they really mind.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and I think I&rsquo;ve been a bit ratty with those people Owen mentioned in his post about adaptation of the Open Government Licence. You know, where they say &lsquo;you can do anything with this data because it&rsquo;s available under the Open Government Licence&hellip; as long as you comply with the following conditions&rsquo;, and then they require you to not use it for anything actually useful. I do think they <em>mean</em> to be open. They just accidentally listened to lawyers who don&rsquo;t understand what open means. So I&rsquo;m sorry for getting angry at them.</p>\n\n<p>And I admit that I have used some bad language. Yes, it was about PAF. Yes, when this amazingly important national information asset was sold off along with Royal Mail. I mean I know from what I read that the government screwed up pretty much every other part of that particular privatisation, but it&rsquo;s the PAF part that&rsquo;s important to me. So yes, I did swear. But it was really fucking stupid.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m hoping, Santa, that you can overlook the bad things I&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;m only putting three things on my list. And I promise I&rsquo;ll be really good and share them if you give them to me.</p>\n\n<p>First, I want a good data portal. I know I know, <em>everyone</em> wants a data portal. You probably have loads of them stacked up at the North Pole just waiting for deployment. But I really really want a <em>good</em> one.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want one that teases me by listing datasets that sound really really interesting from the title, and then I go through to the page, and I read the description and it sounds really juicy, and then, then I look closer and I find that they not open. And it&rsquo;s &lsquo;for commercial reasons&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want one where when it feels like half the data I try to get hold of gives a 404 page. Or where I get bumped to the home page of the organisation that&rsquo;s supposed to be publishing it, and I have to remember the name of the data that I was looking for in the first place so I can search for it there. And I really don&rsquo;t want one where the other half of the data on it is years out of date. I mean I know that people get tired of publishing data, I just hate feeling like I have to wade through piles of unwanted trash every time I use open data.</p>\n\n<p>So please can you give me a data portal that helps me find good, up-to-date data when I need it? I don&rsquo;t care if it only has 20 datasets on it, so long as they&rsquo;re all, you know, not rubbish.</p>\n\n<p>The second thing I&rsquo;d really like is some open data from a big private company. I really don&rsquo;t care what it is. It could be lists of products, or statistics about the business, or a classification scheme that they use. Honestly I don&rsquo;t care. But I want it to be properly open, not open-wash open. Not open where you say it&rsquo;s open and then only let people use it for the duration of a hackathon. Not open where it&rsquo;s free to use so long as you don&rsquo;t use it in a business.</p>\n\n<p>I just want one company that publishes open data properly. One company that thinks that open data is for life, not just for Christmas.</p>\n\n<p>And my third thing, well&hellip; can you destroy Excel? Is that possible? Actually, Excel is a really useful tool, so perhaps not destroy <em>that</em>, just all the open data spreadsheets that it&rsquo;s been used to create? Actually no, not destroy them because then we&rsquo;d lose the data too, so I guess, just <em>change</em> them somehow.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m so fed up with spreadsheets that look beautiful but are really really hard to get data out of. You know those ones with 50 different sheets each of which gives data about one measure? Or ones where there are five tables on one sheet, each one below the next, separated by headers? Or ones where people use tabs <em>within</em> cells, or italics, or bold, to indicate some kind of hierarchy of values?</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know what&rsquo;s worse. Is it the thought that these spreadsheets are being created automatically using some code that could easily be used to create usable data instead? Or is it the thought that each one of these spreadsheets has been lovingly created and crafted by someone?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my final request: no more Excel spreadsheets for data.</p>\n\n<p>I guess these are quite big things to ask for with only five days to go. And now I think of it, I have a sneaking suspicion that I asked for these last year&hellip; Perhaps you need some help? If we work together, perhaps we can aim for <em>next</em> Christmas?</p>\n\n<p>Lots of love,</p>\n\n<p>Jeni</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/announcing-the-new-curator-for-data-as-culture-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/announcing-the-new-curator-for-data-as-culture-2014","slug":"announcing-the-new-curator-for-data-as-culture-2014","title":"Announcing the new curator for Data as Culture 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:20+01:00","created_at":"2014-01-07T14:38:46+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:46+01:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-data-as-culture-panel.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-summit-data-as-culture-panel","slug":"odi-summit-data-as-culture-panel","title":"ODI Summit: Data as Culture - Panel","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:26+01:00","created_at":"2013-12-18T11:35:46+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"ODI have partnered with Lighthouse and FutureEverything to create a series of exhibitions in London, Manchester, and Brighton throughout 2014.\r\n","excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/cc/18/52cc1899d0d4624a8c000018/image_1.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"attachment-52cc1899f362be28b1000013\" /></p>\n\n<p>The ODI has partnered with Lighthouse and FutureEverything to create a series of exhibitions in London, Manchester, and Brighton throughout 2014.</p>\n\n<p>We had a great response to our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/call-for-data-art-curators\">open call for curators</a> with almost 50 extremely high quality submissions from curators all over the world.

These are the BBC, Arup and Deloitte.</p>\n\n<p>ODI Commercial Director Stuart Coleman, explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Deloitte and Arup are leaders in their respective fields. These partnerships represent a great opportunity to exploit open data and drive new value for everyone across professional services, design and engineering communities. Our agreement with the BBC is a great step towards the provision of open access to one of our nation\u2019s greatest cultural assets. We look forward to building upon these relationships.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>BBC</h3>\n\n<p>The BBC and the ODI have today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at Broadcasting House. The MoU marks the BBC\u2019s intention to make data available according to open data standards wherever possible. Another potential future project includes applying ODI <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\" title=\"Open Data Certificates\">Open Data Certificates</a> to BBC open data sources.</p>\n\n<p>James Purnell, Director, Strategy and Digital, BBC, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since its formation just over a year ago the Open Data Institute has galvanised the debate around the economic and cultural value of open data, with the BBC taking an active role in the conversation and attending the recent ODI Summit. This MoU will give a shape to our discussions and help identify areas where we can work together to benefit the public, and I look forward to seeing the results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The BBC today also signed MoU\u2019s with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/\">Mozilla Foundation</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Foundation</a> - further emphasising their support for open knowledge principles and standards.</p>\n\n<h3>Arup</h3>\n\n<p>Arup has joined the ODI membership programme as a \u2018partner\u2019. The firm has long been a champion of using data to help shape a better world. The group is specifically aiming to collaborate with the ODI and its partners on the role of open data in the built environment, not just for buildings and transport but also how we might use data to shape better health-care provision in cities. This is particularly important in an era of rapid urbanisation and the findings from the joint research will be published openly for others to reuse and share.</p>\n\n<p>ODI CEO Gavin Starks, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Arup\u2019s decision to join the ODI reflects data\u2019s interaction with our physical world, and its influence on the practical and material decisions of how we build scalable, resilient cities to help meet the needs of society, our environment, and our economy. Arup produces and consumes huge amounts of data, and is in an excellent position to catalyse open innovation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Volker Buscher, Director and IT and Communications Systems Practice Leader, Arup, said: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The world we live in is increasingly becoming interconnected and there is huge potential to use the data that we generate as a society to enhance our everyday lives. The opportunities are endless as through this information we can make transport more efficient, improve people\u2019s health or reduce waste. But in order to achieve these benefits, we must all work together and that\u2019s not just technologists or governments but people right across society. This ODI initiative provides a platform to be creative, innovative and open about the opportunities that lie ahead. And together, we can be smart about smart cities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Deloitte</h3>\n\n<p>Business advisory firm Deloitte has also joined the ODI\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/membership\" title=\"Membership Programme\">membership programme</a> as a \u2018partner\u2019 and aims to collaborate with the ODI on joint research projects looking into the use-cases for open data. Deloitte is incorporating open data into the analytics work it offers to organisations to provide them with richer insights into their markets and business operations. The firm is also using a wide array of open data in new research to investigate the forces of change on Britain\u2019s banks and building societies.</p>\n\n<p>Costi Perricos, global and UK public sector leader for Deloitte Analytics, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Open data fosters both economic and social growth. It underpins transparency and the Government\u2019s engagement with citizens; it boosts public sector performance; and it is a rich source of new insights and innovative business models that will help to spur growth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We look forward to building our relationship with the ODI under this new agreement. We share a common set of goals: to collaborate and build upon the already exciting research programmes that both organisations undertake, to draw upon Deloitte\u2019s wide-ranging skills and knowledge to help open data start-ups and ultimately, to bring the insights and experience gained from this relationship to help our clients become insight driven organisations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>About the ODI\u2019s Membership Programme</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Since launching in March 2013, the ODI&rsquo;s membership programme has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://directory.theodi.org/members\">signed up 50 organisations</a>, from SME\u2019s to global corporates.

We want to train the next generation of data entrepreneurs whose ambition will be to build new companies and new services using this data.

We\u2019re seeing a trend of large companies who are getting squeezed with their own budgets wanting to outsource their research and development to the community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gavin also talked about the importance of bringing on board start-up companies:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We\u2019re also hearing from smaller companies, interested in us helping with finding funding. So far, we\u2019ve helped to unlock a couple of million pounds worth of funding for start-ups. Just a few weeks ago we published our first open call for start-ups and we had 16 companies submit information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Common Solutions</h2>\n\n<p>Phil Archer of W3C said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In this room are the people who invented link data, the people who work for politicians in the Open Government Partnership who are pushing the politicians to open data and make something magical happen. This workshop was designed to put in the same room people who have different approaches to this subject. We all believe in openness. But we do have different ideas as to how that can happen. This event is about working towards common solutions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Guest Speaker</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/Tom%2DScott.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Web commentator, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.tomscott.com/\">Tom Scott</a>, was invited as guest speaker, and emphasised the importance of ensuring open data benefits everybody:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>8% of adults in Britain don\u2019t own a mobile phone. That\u2019s 4 million people. We do run the risk of leaving a lot of people behind \u2013 not just parents, but anyone who isn\u2019t good with technology, can\u2019t afford a fancier smart phone, or home broadband access. Open data and transparency are wonderful but we do need to make sure that we\u2019re not just producing nice visualisations for text sites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He brought the session to a close with predictions for the future:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Transparency is going to be the norm for everyone, at least in cities and the developed world. The death of privacy is coming but predictions look a bit like Disney\u2019s Tomorrow Land [the past&rsquo;s vision of the future!]. But we do know the trend of openness, for transparency and efficiency won\u2019t stop. Plan for it by all means but don\u2019t leave people behind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Listen in full</h2>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F90173690\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/better-living-through-openness.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/better-living-through-openness","slug":"better-living-through-openness","title":"Better Living Through Openness","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:19+01:00","created_at":"2013-01-31T17:26:38+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"I\u2019ve run and managed various open-source operating systems.

I hope you can see why I wanted to come and work at the ODI.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re Open By Default here. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi\">All of our code is open</a>. This keeps us honest, for one thing: we&rsquo;re far less likely to push an Ugly Hack if everybody can see what we&rsquo;re doing. Score one for Open in the War On Cruft. It will also (hopefully) help us to build a community around the Big Things we&rsquo;re endeavouring to do here. As a nice bonus, it makes deploys that bit easier - no keys required! Of course there&rsquo;s risk, too. You know those times when you put passwords and keys into source control (even though you knew you shouldn&rsquo;t) because that was just easier and you were using a closed repo? Yeah, we can&rsquo;t do that. Especially since Github made it <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/search/advanced\">really easy to search for stuff</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of community, our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"irc://irc.freenode.net/#theodi\">IRC channel</a> is also open. We do work in here, and you can all come hang out with us while we do it. We hope this will be a great vector for building an alliance of like-minded souls. Our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://hubot.github.com/\">Hubot</a> also lives there, and who doesn&rsquo;t like a Hubot?</p>\n\n<p>Our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://jenkins.theodi.org/\">continuous integration system</a> is open too, which is a great incentive for us to keep everything green, and this feeds our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.leftronic.com/share/g/OqF269\">Super Awesome Dashboard</a> (and at the time of writing, I see the Failboat under Jenkins.

The platform is already home to over 50 government datasets that can be accessed and reused by anyone. Datasets on the platform include those from the Ministry of Health on the number of beds in public and private hospitals; the number of malaria deaths and vaccination coverage in Burkina Faso.  </p>\n\n<p>The goal is for local startup companies and entrepreneurs to use this open data to develop innovative new services which will benefit all Burkina citizens. </p>\n\n<p>Over the coming months, the Ministry of Development of the Digital Economy and Post will be raising awareness of the platform and open data amongst all Burkina ministries, with the aim of launching a full version of the platform in September with many more datasets.</p>\n\n<p>Burkina Faso is the first African francophone country to take this step into open data. The platform aims to boost the reputation of the country, encourage foreign investments and economic development, create new jobs in the ICT sector and increase participation from the private sector.  </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore a new open data community project called <strong>\u2018Our Schools, Our Data\u2019 (Nos Ecoles, Nos Donnees)</strong> will be showcased at the launch event, where a 10-hour \u2018visualisation sprint\u2019 will take place. The project has received mentoring from the ODI as part of its support of the Burkina Open Data Initiative and involves gathering government teams, programmers, local tech communities and data-journalists around Burkina Faso\u2019s education-related datasets. A new web app has been built for the project that displays data in a user-friendly way (see video below). </p>\n\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/97404977?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff9933\" width=\"100%\" height=\"391\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>Participants at a workshop will create personalised maps and infographics, using the Our Schools Our Data app and tools like <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/\">Mapbox</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org\">Open Street Map</a>. They will have access to data from schools in the test region of Komki Ipala, including student demographics, level of learning achievements, equipment rates, and the proximity to local services and utilities. For example a participant could bring together data on schools\u2019 access to water and school performance - correlating the two and quickly creating an infographic to show the relationship. The sprint is not a competition, it is a way of showing that everybody (not just developers) can easily reuse open datasets and create online materials.</p>\n\n<p>Our Schools Our Data has been developed to improve citizens\u2019 access to information about schools, as well as helping government better engage with technologists through face to face community building and empowering local communities by training them in surveying techniques and editing software. This in turn allows citizens to have a practical learning opportunity and a positive experience of working with open data. It is also hoped the project will generate interest in open data and spark a multi-stakeholder discussion of where open data should go next in Burkina Faso</p>\n\n<p>Like the open data platform, the goal is for Our Schools, Our Data to be deployed nationally over the coming months. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Liz Carolan, International Development Manager at the Open Data Institute said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With leadership from the very top, and a successful track record of ICT innovation, the Burkina government has shown characteristic ambition and determination to get this initiative off the ground. In doing so they have been able to get officials and citizens in Burkina Faso taking notice of open data. The Open Data Institute and the World Bank have endeavoured to be as light touch as possible - offering advice, bringing together the right people, freeing up funds. The result is an initiative which can potentially bring significant social, economic and environmental benefits to the people of Burkina Faso.     </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Mr. Alfred N. Sawadogo</strong><strong>, **</strong>General Director, National Agency for ICT Promotion (ANPTIC), Ministry of Development of the Digital Economy and Post, Burkina Faso, said:**</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sharing and reuse of public data creates a dynamic of innovation in services to citizens and business. Ensuring that every Burkinabe has access to information in order to improve the quality of his or her life - this is one of the major objectives of the initiative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Charles Ruelle, Technology Strategist at ODI Paris (FivebyFive), prior CTO of Etalab, the French Prime Minister&rsquo;s task force for open data, said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Burkina government has a strong background of collecting and producing data, especially in education, health and demography statistics. After having recently launched successful ICT projects, the Burkina government is now opening its information in the form of open data. These free raw materials will allow businesses, scientists, NGOs, communities, citizens and government to work together to find innovative ways to meet the daily challenges of the country.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"ODI News: Burkina Faso: Our schools, our data","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[{"title":"Burkina Faso: data portal","url":"http://data.gov.bf/"}]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/cc-40-and-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/cc-40-and-open-data","slug":"cc-40-and-open-data","title":"CC 4.0 and Open Data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:13+01:00","created_at":"2013-12-06T12:16:30+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"After a lengthy two year development process the Creative Commons recently announced the publication of their Version 4.0 licences. The new licences include a raft of changes based on lessons learned through application of the Creative Commons licences around the world.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p>After a lengthy two year development process the Creative Commons recently <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40768\">announced the publication of their Version 4.0 licences</a>. The new licences include a raft of changes based on lessons learned through application of the Creative Commons licences around the world.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/Version4\">changes</a> include a number that relate to data publication, making the release an important milestone for those publishing or using open data. In this blog post I wanted to summarise a few of those changes to highlight how they are relevant to the publication and sharing of open data.</p>\n\n<h3>Database Rights</h3>\n\n<p>Traditionally, Creative Commons (CC) licences have used copyright law to allow rights holders to waive specific rights over their content. This works well for text, images, videos etc. But it has been problematic for dealing with sharing of data and databases. In some jurisdictions the creator of a database may have gained additional rights \u2014 sometimes referred to as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_are_sui_generis_database_rights.3F\">sui generis rights</a> \u2014 over some data, e.g. as part of the process of its compilation. This is true in the European Union which has legislation relating to database rights.</p>\n\n<p>As these databases rights are different from copyright, they were either not covered by the Creative Commons licences or were inconsistently addressed. This lead to the creation of new <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/\">data licences</a> intended to address the short-fall.</p>\n\n<p>This issue has been fixed in the Version 4.0 licences, which now explicitly address database rights, making them more suitable for data publishing. For open data, the CC-BY 4.0 and CC-BY-SA 4.0 licences are now a viable option for publishing both data and content. This greatly simplifies the licensing process, allowing publishers to pick from a single family of licences for all of their open works. </p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data\">Creative Commons Data guidance</a> provides a good overview of how the new licences work with respect to both copyright and database rights. The ODI <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing\">publishers</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/reusers-guide-open-data-licensing\">re-users</a> guides to data licensing also provide good introductions to this topic. These introductory guides have now been supplemented with additional technical guidance on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary\">how to publish machine-readable rights statements</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/odrs-reusers-guide\">how to use that information in applications</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While the CC licences can be applied to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data#Which_components_of_databases_are_protected_by_copyright.3F\">all elements of a database</a> our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary\">recommendation</a> is to clearly label databases with both a content and a data licence to avoid any ambiguity.</p>\n\n<h3>Attribution</h3>\n\n<p>Correctly attributing data sources is an important part of building trust around open data and applications. However the attribution requirements for publishers are often unclear, or can be awkward to implement in some scenarios, e.g. in mobile applications. The ODI <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/\">Rights Statement vocabulary</a> is intended to improve this situation by ensuring that the relevant information is available in a machine-readable form. However there is still plenty of scope to explore approaches to attributing and citing datasets.</p>\n\n<p>With the new release, the Creative Commons have revised <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_properly_attribute_material_offered_under_a_Creative_Commons_license.3F\">their approach to attribution</a>, adopting a &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; approach that recognises the need for flexibility around how attribution is performed. Importantly it allows re-users to link to their attribution statements, rather than including them on every page or screen. </p>\n\n<p>For example, developers re-using CC licensed data can now create a general &ldquo;acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;colophon&rdquo; page in their application to refer to their sources. Particularly useful if you are re-using a large number of datasets, this seems like a good practice to encourage more widely across the community.</p>\n\n<h3>Global Application</h3>\n\n<p>There are numerous other changes to the CC licences which generally improve their use for supporting the global publication of open data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>simplified language makes it easier for non-experts to understand the terms of each licence</li>\n  <li>a single set of licences suitable for all jurisdictions allows them to be re-used, unchanged, around the world</li>\n  <li>translations into multiple languages facilitates re-use by many different people</li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_can_I_lose_my_rights_under_a_Creative_Commons_license.3F_If_that_happens.2C_how_do_I_get_them_back.3F\">accidental license infringements can now be fixed</a>, avoiding a complete loss of rights over some data</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The UK OGL v2.0 has been defined to be compatible with CC-BY 4.0. Now the licence has been formally published, re-users in the UK and beyond can now safely adapt and re-publish UK Government material under compatible licences from the Creative Commons family.</p>\n\n<p>While CC-BY 4.0 and CC-BY-SA 4.0 are not yet marked as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/\">conformant</a> with the Open Definition, this review will shortly be getting underway and is unlikely to identify any major issues.</p>\n\n<p>All things considered the CC 4.0 licences (CC-BY 4.0, CC-BY-SA 4.0, CC0) form a viable default option that should be given serious consideration by any open data and open government data initiative.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","web_url":"http://theodi.org/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","web_url":"http://theodi.org/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/csvhub-github-diffs-for-csv-files.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/csvhub-github-diffs-for-csv-files","slug":"csvhub-github-diffs-for-csv-files","title":"CSVHub - GitHub diffs for CSV files","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:29+01:00","created_at":"2014-05-23T13:01:39+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/git-data-publishing.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/git-data-publishing","slug":"git-data-publishing","title":"Git for Data Publishing","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:47+01:00","created_at":"2013-05-20T10:35:06+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/adapting-git-simple-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/adapting-git-simple-data","slug":"adapting-git-simple-data","title":"Adapting Git for simple data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:41+01:00","created_at":"2013-08-19T15:10:22+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/7f/3c/537f3c4b1f986a085f000010/Screen_Shot_2014-05-22_at_21.24.46.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"attachment-537f3c4bf362be0d4200006d\" /></p>\n\n<p>Over the last few months, I&rsquo;ve spent some time working on how we collaborate on data publishing, particularly when using <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://github.com\">GitHub</a>, an integral part of our software development process.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote a couple of articles last year about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/adapting-git-simple-data\">how git could be used for data</a>, and came to the conclusion that rendering of CSV diffs was an important feature that was needed. Using Paul Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s brilliant <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/paulfitz/daff\">daff</a> library, I put CSV diffs into GitLab (an open source GitHub clone), but then again most people aren&rsquo;t using that.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after this, GitHub added CSV viewing support in their web interface, which is fantastic, but still doesn&rsquo;t handle changes well.</p>\n\n<p>Well, this week was innovation week again, and my colleague Stuart came up with the suggestion of putting the CSV diff capability we did for GitLab into a browser plugin that would work on the main GitHub site.

The list will also assist organizations discovering other organizations that might provide partnering or collaboration opportunities The methodology and processes will follow the work of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://thegovlab.org/\">GovLab</a> at NYU on their work on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opendata500.com/\">Open Data 500</a> in the United States.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open Data Reference Model</strong></p>\n\n<p>In all sectors there is a need for standards, and the same applies to the Open Data community. CODI has initiated a project which seeks to evolve the Municipal Data Reference Model to an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatainstitute.ca/projects/\">Open Data Reference Mode</a>l that can apply initially to public sector data and subsequently to include NGO data to assist in the ease and consistency of open data discovery and use. The project focuses on three areas: standardizing the categories/groups for data sets (possible use as tags); adding &ldquo;Also Known As&rdquo; names of data sets; and to initiate an inventory of existing standards and organizations involved in standards related to the open data community. Preliminary discussions have been held on potential collaboration from a local \u2013 global level. All are invited to contribute!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Open Data Request Framework</strong></p>\n\n<p>CODI is working with Cycle Toronto to develop a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatainstitute.ca/projects/\">framework</a>that can be reused by any community member or group who wants open data and is new to asking for it and/or using it in their advocacy efforts. This will include a process to help identify: what kind of data is available to any given community, what kind of data will be helpful to advocacy objectives, who to ask for the data, how to ask for it, how to best use it in advocacy (e.g. data visualizations, applications), how to advocate for data sets that don\u2019t yet exist and how to share the process with others in the community, as well as other elements to add to the framework that are uncovered through the case study.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Academic Open Data Research Repository</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is an increasing amount of research being undertaken on open data. A project is being initiated by CODI to facilitate the creation/expansion of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatainstitute.ca/projects/\">Academic Open Data Research repository</a>. Community discussions have confirmed the value of having a single, searchable repository of not only existing academic papers/studies but also to introduce planned research projects. There has been a preliminary review of the possible use of the Open Research Network\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/opening_science/items/collectionKey/5A7JAT67\">Zotero Open Data Research repository</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Community Engagement</strong></p>\n\n<p>CODI maintains community engagement as a primary task. In collaboration with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.urbandigital.ca/\">urban + digital</a>, CODI co-hosted an event <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://airmail.calendar/2013-12-13%2012:00:00%20GMT\">on December 13th</a> with guest speaker Jean-No\u00e9 Landry from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://montrealouvert.net/\">Montreal Ouvert</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://quebecouvert.org/\">Qu\u00e9bec Ouvert</a> to share success stories from Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s open data community with the Toronto community.

The purpose of the ODI is as a catalyst.</p>\n\n<p>If we don\u2019t engage, then everyone will create their own \u201copen\u201d strategy. This is a good thing, but we believe would miss the opportunity to use the power of globally connected networks to share and enable change. If we create a centralised network, we are at risk of getting in the way of the very outcomes we\u2019d all like to see.</p>\n\n<p>We think the better question is;</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cHow can we build a global open data network together?\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p>borrowing from web itself, and building in concert with existing communities (such as OKF, MySociety, Code for America, individual open government initiatives, the startup and business communities, and existing research communities): combining this \u2018global coincidence of desires\u2019 with the shared insight, tools and network that we have all helped to create.

Our thought is that the ideal ODI node is any organisation (new or existing) that will:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>collaborate to build open data expertise in a country, region, city, sector, or domain</li>\n  <li>bring resources to the network to bridge between private, public and third sectors</li>\n  <li>commit to measurable reach, engagement and impact targets</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>An organisation should be a legal entity (a for-profit, or not-for-profit organisation) with which we can agree a set of principles, and a set of rules. Principles could include commitments to training, building capabilities, research, standards, or mentoring open data startups. Rules need to be light enough to not restrict development, but strong enough that we can protect our collective work and give confidence to users and funders (for example, protect our reputation using brand licensing).\u0002\nThe ODI is committed to being an open organisation itself, and over the coming months we will be opening up our own data about our finances, plans and performance metrics. We already open source all our development work.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Gavin Starks","slug":"gavin-starks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks","tag_ids":["board","executive","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Gavin Starks","slug":"gavin-starks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks","tag_ids":["board","executive","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-challenge-crime-winner.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-challenge-crime-winner","slug":"open-data-challenge-crime-winner","title":"Check That Bike wins Crime & Justice Open Data Challenge","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:27+01:00","created_at":"2014-02-05T13:04:39+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries","slug":"opendatachallengeseries","title":"Open Data Challenge Series","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:38+01:00","created_at":"2012-12-13T09:45:46+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-crime-and-justice-open-data-sources-and-resources.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-crime-and-justice-open-data-sources-and-resources","slug":"guest-blog-crime-and-justice-open-data-sources-and-resources","title":"Guest blog: Crime and Justice - Open Data Sources and Resources","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:50+01:00","created_at":"2013-06-05T12:05:01+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"At last night\u2019s awards ceremony we announced the winner of the first Challenge in the [Open Data Challenge Series](http://www.nesta.org.uk/project/open-data-challenge-series) being run by Nesta and the Open Data Institute.

Using the unique frame number of the bike and with the aid of a smartphone, cyclists are able to make a better decision about buying a second hand bike at the time they\u2019re actually buying it.</p>\n\n<p>John\u2019s idea to disrupt the market in stolen bikes is a credible new example of how open data released by the public sector can be developed into services which are both socially useful and sustainable businesses.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://checkthatbike.co.uk/\">Check That Bike</a> faced competition from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://totalcarcheck.co.uk/\">Total Car Check</a>, and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.peskypeople.co.uk\">Pesky People</a>, a team who are developing an app to help deaf people communicate with the Emergency Services using geo-location data. </p>\n\n<h3>Broader social impacts</h3>\n\n<p>Around half a million bikes are stolen in the UK every year, with only a tiny number recovered and returned to the owner. These thefts cost cyclists (an estimated \u00a3140 million a year) as well as meaning that they are more likely to give up cycling or cycle less often. John\u2019s winning idea aims to incentivise cyclists to report thefts in the first instance, as well as help the police return stolen bikes. </p>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/115307696&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=false\"></iframe>\n\n<p>A service like <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://checkthatbike.co.uk/\">Check That Bike</a> will help change behaviour in the cycling community with cyclists now seeing the point of making a record of their frame number when they buy a new bike, as well as using the service at the point at which they buy a second hand bike. </p>\n\n<p>By helping to combat bike theft, John\u2019s idea will help to tackle one of the main reasons that people don\u2019t take up cycling - the fear of getting their bike stolen. In it\u2019s own way, this will help to contribute to the broader moves by government and others to get more people to see the health benefits of taking up cycling.</p>\n\n<h3>New direction for Crime and Justice open data innovation</h3>\n\n<p>One of the reasons why the judges felt that John\u2019s idea was particularly innovative was that it provided an example of how opening up data could support the public task of the organisations releasing data. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://checkthatbike.co.uk/\">Check That Bike</a> is not only providing a service to cyclists but by changing the behaviour of cyclists could also impact the way police approach this category of crime - using their data to help disrupt the market for stolen goods. </p>\n\n<p>And it isn\u2019t an approach that applies just to stolen bikes, but could also to other types of stolen property and hence, build a new range of services which we would all use to check whether something we\u2019re buying is stolen or not. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, this service is already available for stolen cars, and another finalist in the Challenge, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://totalcarcheck.co.uk/\">Total Car Check</a>, is developing as service which will pull in open data on stolen cars if and when it becomes available. </p>\n\n<p>This is the crux of the issue, in that supporting approaches to tackling crime in this way is dependent on the police becoming comfortable with making data available. In the case of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://checkthatbike.co.uk/\">Check That Bike</a> there is at least one police force actively considering the release of the stolen bikes data - the West Midlands.</p>\n\n<p>To hear interviews with the other finalists, follow <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/news/new-initiatives-combat-crime-open-data\">this link</a>.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"Briony Phillips","media_enquiries_email":"briony.phillips@theodi.org","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"At last night\u2019s awards ceremony we announced the winner of the first Challenge in the Open Data Challenge Series.","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/code-europe-odi.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/code-europe-odi","slug":"code-europe-odi","title":"Code for Europe at the ODI","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:31+01:00","created_at":"2013-03-05T12:11:40+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The ODI is hosting Code for Europe Fellows who arein Londonmeeting open data entrepreneursand sharing advice and ideas with one another.Code for Europe is working with city authorities across Europe to engage data technologists inexploringsolutions to city challenges.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p>The ODI is hosting <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://codeforeurope.net\">Code for Europe </a>Fellows who are\u0002in London\u0002meeting open data entrepreneurs\u0002and sharing advice and ideas with one another.\u0002Code for Europe is working with city authorities across Europe to engage data technologists in\u0002exploring\u0002solutions to city challenges.\u0002\nThe group is visiting London from 4th to 6th March and will be meeting organisations including\u0002<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://mysociety.org\">mySociety</a>\u0002and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://wearemudlark.com/\">Mudlark</a> as well as ODI-based start-ups, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.locatable.com\">Locatable</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.placr.co.uk\">Placr</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mastodonc.com\">Mastodon C</a>.\u0002Representatives from Code for Africa and Code for Latin America will\u0002also join a Code for Europe\u0002workshop at the ODI.\u0002\nSo far, six cities are involved in the initiative\u0002- \u0002Manchester, Helsinki, Barcelona, Rome, Amsterdam and Berlin \u2013 with \u0002ambitions to increase the numbers over the next year-to-18-months.</p>\n\n<p>In each city there is a team of technologists-in-residence, working on a\u0002digital service project.

Could we use the code we&rsquo;ve already written to use <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travis-ci.org\">Travis</a> to test the data and use a similar flow to our code?</p>\n\n<p>I decided to use my innovation time to find out - the result is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/cid\">Cid</a>, a Ruby script which validates data in a Github repo, and can generate a new <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/\">Datapackage</a> and push this to Github automatically if the validation is sucessful. If you&rsquo;re interested in the nuts and bolts of it, you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/cid/blob/master/README.md\">read the README</a>, but I&rsquo;d like to use this blog post to ask for your help to test it out.</p>\n\n<p>As we know, at the time of writing, voting in the UK European Elections took place yesterday. The count won&rsquo;t take place until Sunday night, so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to try out Cid, and see what collaborating on data in real time looks like.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve set up a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections\">repo in Github</a> which will contain the data. There&rsquo;s detailed instructions on how to submit your data <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections/blob/gh-pages/README.md\">in the Readme</a> (it assumes at least some knowledge of Github, but you don&rsquo;t need to be a developer to submit some data). </p>\n\n<p>If you fancy helping, I&rsquo;ve listed the regions <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections/issues?labels=help+wanted%2CRegions&amp;page=1&amp;state=open\">on Github here</a>, and added a link to where the results will be published (according to the Electoral Commision&rsquo;s website) - please comment on the region you&rsquo;re planning to submit data for, and once the results are announced, check that council&rsquo;s website for the results, add them to a spreadsheet and submit a pull request.</p>\n\n<p>Although the European Commission are planning to publish open data on the election results themselves, I&rsquo;m hoping this will be a nice proof of concept for wider publication of collaborative open data, as well as a starting point for something around next year&rsquo;s general election, which, so far, has never had a single point of reference for open data.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/euro-elections/issues\">open an issue on GitHub</a> or comment below.

We write some code (with tests), publish it to a branch, and then open a pull request. If the tests pass (on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\">Travis</a>), someone else reviews the code and merges it. Once the tests pass on the master branch, a tag is applied to the code and the Chef robots (which run every 10 minutes or so), pick the code up and deploy it to our servers. </p>\n\n<p>Up until now, we haven&rsquo;t been able to apply this approach to our Chef cookbooks. We test them, sure, but it&rsquo;s tricky to test infrastructure on Travis, because it&rsquo;s difficult (nay, impossble) to spin up virtual machines within the virtual machines that Travis spin up to test our code.</p>\n\n<p>However, we&rsquo;ve recently started using <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://kitchen.ci/\">Test Kitchen</a> to test our Chef recipes, and thanks to some wonderful tools that other people have built, this is a lot easier. </p>\n\n<p>When running Test Kitchen on our local machines, the default behaviour is to use <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a> to launch a virtual machine, apply the recipes and then use <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://serverspec.org/\">ServerSpec</a> to test the behaviour (For more information, check out the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://kitchen.ci/\">Test Kitchen Docs</a>).</p>\n\n<p>When we are running our tests on Travis, however, we need to do things a little differently. Instead of spinning up a virtual machine on Travis, we use <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-rackspace\">Kitchen Rackspace</a> to spin up a VM on Rackspace for us. The tests are then run on that machine, and the server is destroyed for us, meaning we pay pennies for a short-lived server.</p>\n\n<p>Getting this set up is a little tricky, so I thought I&rsquo;d give something back and document this process, so that future generations (that&rsquo;s you, dear reader) might benefit.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming you&rsquo;ve got Test Kitchen set up, and have everything set up in Travis, the first thing to do is add <code>kitchen-rackspace</code> to your Gemfile like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gem 'kitchen-rackspace'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then run <code>bundle install</code>. The next thing to do is create a new <code>.kitchen.yml</code> file. (We&rsquo;ve called it <code>.kitchen.cloud.yml</code> as this seems to be the convention), and add the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>---\ndriver:\n  name: rackspace\n  rackspace_username: &lt;%= ENV['RACKSPACE_USERNAME'] %&gt;\n  rackspace_api_key: &lt;%= ENV['RACKSPACE_API_KEY'] %&gt;\n  rackspace_region: lon\n  require_chef_omnibus: latest\n\nprovisioner:\n  name: chef_zero\n\nplatforms:\n  - name: ubuntu-12.04\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then add your run list to the file from your existing <code>.kitchen.yml</code> file. You may want to tweak some of the settings above to suit your needs. See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-rackspace\">kitchen-rackspace docs for more</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth pointing out that the <code>platforms</code> section will only work if the <code>name</code> is referred to in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-rackspace/blob/master/data/images.json\">JSON file included in the kitchen-rackspace gem</a>. If you want to use a different platform, you can list the ones available to you by running: </p>\n\n<pre><code> knife rackspace image list --rackspace-region=lon --rackspace-username=$RACKSPACE_USERNAME --rackspace-api-key=$RACKSPACE_API_KEY\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where <code>$RACKSPACE_USERNAME</code> is your Rackspace Username and <code>$RACKSPACE_API_KEY</code> is your Rackspace API key.</p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll notice we&rsquo;re passing some environment variables to the YAML file. These can be encrypted and added to your <code>.travis.yml</code> file on the command line like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>travis encrypt RACKSPACE_USERNAME=YOUR_RACKSPACE_USERNAME --add\ntravis encrypt RACKSPACE_API_KEY=YOUR_RACKSPACE_API_KEY --add\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once that&rsquo;s done, you need to add a few more things to your <code>.travis.yml</code> file. Firstly, you need to make sure the Travis VM has an ssh key (they don&rsquo;t by default). This allows <code>kitchen-rackspace</code> to transfer the necessary files to your Rackspace node, trigger the Chef run, and run the tests:</p>\n\n<pre><code>before_script:\n   - ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa -N ''\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The next thing to do is add the environment variable <code>KITCHEN_YAML</code> to your Travis env to make sure Test Kitchen knows what YAML file to use. The <code>env</code> section of your <code>.travis.yml</code> file should look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>env:\n  global:\n  - secure: SOME_ENCRYPTED_TOKEN\n  - secure: ANOTHER_ENCRYPTED_TOKEN\n  - KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen.cloud.yml\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, the next thing to do, is tell Travis what command to run to run your tests. In our live projects, we&rsquo;ve got a Rakefile which runs some other tests as well as Test Kitchen, but, in the interests of keeping it simple, we&rsquo;ll just run Test Kitchen here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>script: \n  - travis_wait 35 kitchen test --destroy=always\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first thing to note is the <code>kitchen test</code> command is preceeded by <code>travis_wait 35</code>, this is a special Travis command which stops Travis from timing out until the following command has been running for 35 minutes. Normally Travis will time out after 10 minutes, and this often isn&rsquo;t enough for the whole test run to happen. We&rsquo;re building a virtual machine from scratch remember? <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-timeouts/#Build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received\">You can see more about <code>travis_wait</code> here</a></p>\n\n<p>The <code>--destroy=always</code> tag is important because by default, Test Kitchen only destroys your box after a successful test. We don&rsquo;t want additional servers hanging around and costing us money, so we&rsquo;ll kill them every time.</p>\n\n<p>By now, your <code>.travis.yml</code> file should look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>language: ruby\nrvm:\n- 2.1.0\nbefore_script:\n  - ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -t rsa -N ''\nscript:\n  - kitchen test --destroy=always\nenv:\n  global:\n  - secure: SOME_ENCRYPTED_TOKEN\n  - secure: ANOTHER_ENCRYPTED_TOKEN\n  - KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen.cloud.yml\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You could just stop there, add your project to Travis and push your changes, then upload your cookbook to the Chef server, but as I mentioned before, we&rsquo;re all about continuous deployment here, so we want to go one step further - if the tests pass on master, we want to upload our cookbook to the Chef server.</p>\n\n<p>To get this done, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure you&rsquo;re using <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://berkshelf.com/\">Berkshelf</a>. Firstly, add:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gem 'berkshelf'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To your Gemfile, then run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bundle install\nberks init .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You will then have a <code>Berksfile</code> in your project root. You can use this to manage cookbook dependencies, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://berkshelf.com/\">more on this on the Berkshelf website here</a>, but for the sake of argument, we&rsquo;ll just leave the Berksfile as it is.</p>\n\n<p>The next step is to add a <code>berkshelf.json</code> file to your repository. We tend to put this in a deploy subdirectory.</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  \"chef\": {\n    \"chef_server_url\": \"https://chef.theodi.org\",\n    \"client_key\": \"deploy/key.pem\",\n    \"node_name\": \"odi\"\n  },\n  \"ssl\": {\n    \"verify\": false\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This tells Berkshelf where to upload the cookbook to. Note it needs the client key PEM file. This should <em>not</em> be added to version control. In order to get this, we add an encrypted version to git, and decrypt it on Travis with an environment variable.</p>\n\n<pre><code>export CHEF_KEY=SOME-UNIQUE-KEY\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -k \"$CHEF_KEY\" -in deploy/key.pem -out deploy/key.enc -a -e\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We then need to add our unique key to Travis like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>travis encrypt CHEF_KEY=${CHEF_KEY} --add\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then add <code>deploy/key.enc</code> to version control.</p>\n\n<p>For convenience, we usually add a rake task to handle the berkshelf upload:</p>\n\n<pre><code>namespace :berkshelf do\n\n  desc \"Upload cookbook to chef server\"\n  task :upload do\n    sh \"bundle exec berks upload -c deploy/berkshelf.json\"\n  end\n\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, in your travis config, after successful master builds, you want to decrypt the PEM file and run the rask task:</p>\n\n<pre><code>after_success:\n- openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -k $CHEF_KEY -in deploy/key.enc -out deploy/key.pem\n- chmod 600 deploy/key.pem\n- bundle exec berks install\n- \"[ \\\"$TRAVIS_BRANCH\\\" == \\\"master\\\" ] &amp;&amp; [ \\\"$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST\\\" == \\\"false\\\"] &amp;&amp; bundle exec rake berkshelf:upload\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, when your build passes, Travis should try to upload the new cookbook to the Chef server. Bingo!</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Stuart Harrison","slug":"stuart-harrison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-harrison","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Stuart Harrison","slug":"stuart-harrison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-harrison","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/data-sharing-is-not-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/data-sharing-is-not-open-data","slug":"data-sharing-is-not-open-data","title":"Data Sharing is Not Open Data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:49+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-17T18:56:55+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"One of the disturbing trends that we\u2019ve noticed over the past year is the government justifying data sharing as if it is part of satisfying wider open data policy.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p>One of the disturbing trends that we&rsquo;ve noticed over the past year is the government justifying data sharing as if it is part of satisfying wider open data policy.</p>\n\n<p>Data sharing is not open data.</p>\n\n<p>This post explains the difference between data sharing and open data, and how the two overlap.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data sharing is providing restricted data to restricted organisations or individuals.</strong> Access to this data is usually restricted because it is sensitive in some way, either because it is personal or because its general release might cause security problems. Data sharing might be with the individuals that the data is about (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/personal-data\">midata</a>), within government, or outside government such as to researchers, charities or commercial companies. Examples that we have seen proposed by government are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.education.gov.uk/consultations/index.cfm?action=conResults&amp;consultationId=1854\">the Department for Education providing more access to the National Pupil Database to data analytics companies</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/sharing-and-publishing-data-for-public-benefit\">HMRC providing the full VAT register only to credit reference agencies</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/records/healthrecords/Pages/care-data.aspx\">NHS England providing pseudonymised health data to pharmaceutical firms</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Open data is providing unrestricted data to everyone.</strong> By definition, open data must be available to all without restrictions on what they do with it. And the corollary of that is there cannot be any legal restrictions on making that data available. For example personal data can only be open data if it is written in law that it must be published (for example, insolvency notices in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.thegazette.co.uk/\">London Gazette</a>) or if the affected individuals have given their permission for that publication.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>More data is always more useful (if you know what to do with it).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are lots of companies, charities and individuals who would benefit if all the data the public sector holds was shared with them, particularly if it was shared <em>only</em> with them. Those benefits have to be balanced against the rights of individuals to have their data protected by government and the risks to individuals and to society of too much data being available (for example, through making fraud easier).</p>\n\n<p>We believe that releasing open data is the right way of achieving that balance. It can satisfy a lot of the demand for data. It ensures a level playing field because everyone receives the same information. And it limits the release of personal data.</p>\n\n<p>When data sharing arrangements are put in place, we recommend using open data to minimise the number of restricted data releases that are made, to make the process transparent, and to ensure that everyone benefits from it. Namely:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Release open data.</strong> Provide aggregate and anonymised information that satisfies the majority of the demands that organisations have for data.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Document the data and the process to access it.</strong> It should be clear what the data holds, and the robust process that those who get hold of it have to go through to be granted access. See the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-pupil-database\">information on the National Pupil Database</a> as a good example.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Publish all requests for access as open data.</strong> The public has a right to know who is asking for, and being granted access, to their data and for what purpose. When this is transparent, it reassures the public that there is a robust process in place for granting access, and it discourages organisations for requesting data that they don&rsquo;t have a good reason for needing.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Require the publication of the results of data analysis as open data.</strong> The public should benefit from the results of analyses of public data \u2013 there should be a requirement for publication of anonymised derived datasets that result from priviledged access to the data.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Monitor repeated requests.</strong> When the same data is requested repeatedly, including by different organisations, this is a signal that the analysis should be carried out by the organisation that holds the data and the result then published as open data for all to benefit from.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is lots of data within the public sector that should be open. There is also lots of data that the public sector holds that should not be shared. We should take care not to confuse the two.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/data-culture-recession-crisps-fuel-odi-staff.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/data-culture-recession-crisps-fuel-odi-staff","slug":"data-culture-recession-crisps-fuel-odi-staff","title":"Data as Culture: Recession Crisps Fuel ODI Staff","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:21+01:00","created_at":"2013-01-14T16:11:31+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"Sliding over to the other-side is not something to be taken lightly.

The commission programme not only enabled me to meet other artists that feel the same, but gave us all a platform to share our passion with an audience.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Data as an art material</strong><br />\n Why work with the intangible? What is alluring about a material you can\u2019t touch? I can partly answer this; throughout my own practice I\u2019ve used data in many different ways - <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.translatingnature.org/dogs-ears/\">generating</a> it, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.translatingnature.org/the-observatories/\">collecting</a> it, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.translatingnature.org/the-lake/\">sonifying</a> it, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.translatingnature.org/digital-wave/\">randomising</a> it, making it <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.translatingnature.org/lepidopteral/\">physical</a>, and, on occasion, getting really quite <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.translatingnature.org/specious-dialogue-iii/\">angry</a> with it. It has played a significant part in every piece of work I\u2019ve made, and over the years my relationship with data has grown into something veering on obsessive - I can\u2019t make work without it. This is something that has become increasingly shared (Oh hi ODI <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/team\">folk</a>!), but also more complex, and it has led me to study it in more depth through a PhD scholarship at Queen Mary University of London\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mat.qmul.ac.uk\">Media and Arts Technology</a> lab.  </p>\n\n<p>Data is such a broad term - and often it is easy to forget that it is mainly collections of values that help us understand a phenomenon such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\">country well-being</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hint.fm/wind\">weather activity</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nova.edu/%7Ejohnmatt/tigerbermuda2010.htm\">tiger shark activity</a>, or, of course, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.google.com/settings/activity/signup?hl=en-GB\">ourselves</a>. In this era of data-driven decision making (at personal and global levels) it is important to remember we are not trying to understand data itself, we are using it to deepen our understanding of the world. It is important then, to ensure that the politics of data are pure and open, and that any <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/damodaran-dark-side-of-numbers-2013-1?utm_source=Pulse&amp;utm_medium=App&amp;utm_campaign=partner&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pulsenews\">bias</a> that may colour its meaning is absent.  </p>\n\n<p>For the Data as Culture commision <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mztek.org/about\">Sophie McDonald</a> and I set about looking for, and working with, artists that use datasets intrinsically and viscerally in their work to convey meaning in new ways, sometimes highlighting over-processing or abstract representation, sometimes providing a direct mapping.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>A diversity of data</strong><br />\n Collectively, the data sets* include real-time environmental and news data, historical anecdotal data from 2000BC, local image data mashed-up through retro software applications, raw sound and video data printed as patterns, search terms graphed in a newspaper, reconfigured static geographic information and dynamic geomagnetic data visualised in 3D. Every single work is different and uses unique data in a unique way, but describing this is not easy - the word \u201cdata\u201d is akin to saying \u201cobject\u201d: it&rsquo;s too generic to be meaningful. There is clearly a need to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://translatingdata.org/data-in-art-draft-taxonomy/\">define data types</a> and formats in clear and understandable terms.  </p>\n\n<p>It is the real-time aliveness in some of the works that hold suspense and keep interest: <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ellieharrison.com/\">Ellie Harrison</a>&rsquo;s Vending Machine came to life on the day of a governmental budget announcement \u2013 as the fiscal news was reported, the machine dispensed so many packets of crisps that the flap wouldn\u2019t open. A small snack mountain to see us through the triple-dip [recession]. Vending Machine is a monitor, keeping an eye on the latest economic oscillations, and dispensing sustenance when there is something to report; the element of humour helps us through tough times.  </p>\n\n<p>Moving from real-time to an historic time scale, \u201cThree flames ate the sun, and big stars were seen\u201d by artist <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://philarcher.net/\">Phil Archer</a> provides us with a condensed snapshot of solar eclipses over a 4000 year timespan - prompting us to consider whether a single day of bad economic news really matters that much&hellip;  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Artworks as provocateurs \u0002</strong><br />\n There are <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/culture/collection\">nine works</a> to view, all providing a different perspective for us to think about how data can be used. A <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://bit.ly/ZQh1i2\">question</a> raised at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/events/byo-lunchtime-lectures-data-culture\">ODI lunchtime lecture</a> on the collection was whether a claim of artistic merit can be based on obscuration of sources (a number of the works use data for dynamism but the direct correlation isn\u2019t visible). A further comment noted that perhaps now data is more openly available there is less need to directly translate the information, but more freedom to play and experiment with it. This question of the sacred role of data is explored in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://fabiolattanziantinori.com/\">The Obelisk</a>&rsquo;s constant rhythmic flicker, composed from RSS newsfeeds that mention crimes against humanity. It is less a device to keep watch but more a constant reminder that skullduggery continues to be perpetrated every second of every day: lest we forget.   </p>\n\n<p>Art often makes visible the emergent before we understand what role it will play in our lives - we are seeing a lot more instances of data being used to trigger activity and subtly <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://goodnightlamp.com/\">communicate</a> with us in our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/\">homes</a> and elsewhere. \u0002As easily as we notice body language, we will soon learn to read objects and environments as they respond to data feeds, enabling the ever-increasing streams of information to be synthesised into an absorbable framework that is useful or beautiful or, \u0002ideally, both. \u0002  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Respectful infiltration</strong><br />\n Curating the collection of data-driven artworks for the ODI, was one of my highlights of 2012. It is always hard to place dynamic art outside of a gallery context. The ODI is a busy, vibrant space used by busy, vibrant, people. For the artwork to have an impact it needed to be noticeable but not distracting, eye-catching but not a spectacle. The balance between ensuring the artists intention was preserved, and the audience and environmental needs were met was an important one to achieve, I hope we have done this.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Cultural change</strong><br />\n I learned a lot throughout the entire process, from the initial concept to the call for submissions to the selection, installation and launch but none of these aspects delighted me as much as the feedback/response we received from the ODI&rsquo;s team and visitors about the impact of the artworks on their environment. The works not only change the aesthetics of the space, and are a talking point for every single visitor (over 700 in the last three months), but they have contributed to the cultural development of the ODI itself (including a direct impact on its mission statement) at the crucial early stage of its formation.  </p>\n\n<p>The works can be visited by appointment and during open days - dates to be released soon.</p>\n\n<p>A <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/theODI/data-as-culture#btnAudioPlay\">slideshow of the Data as Culture artworks</a>, recorded at the ODI&rsquo;s first BYO Friday Lecture is now available. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/events\">More BYO Friday Lectures</a> are now open for registration.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Julie Freeman @misslake</em>  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Data Sources &amp; Types:<br />\n Text Trends -

Not content with a load of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa\">different</a> <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dataprotocols.org/\">metadata</a> [formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML), there are also a bunch of different <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://schema.org/Dataset\">naming</a> <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/\">schemes</a>, adding an extra layer of confusion.</p>\n\n<p>As a developer wanting to create something that grabs datasets straight off the web, these differences in format are a pain, particularly when you&rsquo;re making something like, oh, an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://certificates.theodi.org\">Open Data Certificate</a>, or a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://git-viewer.labs.theodi.org\">data previewer for git repositories</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, to help our apps understand all these different formats, we&rsquo;ve created a Ruby gem called <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/data_kitten\">Data Kitten</a> (it&rsquo;s a play on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/\">DCAT</a>, the vocabulary that we&rsquo;ve decided to use for naming conventions internally).</p>\n\n<p>Data Kitten does something pretty handy. If you give it the URL of a dataset, it will run off, knock it around a bit like a ball of wool, and try to work out what it can about the dataset. You can then ask it what the license is, or who maintains it, without worrying about exactly how the dataset is stored or what format the metadata is in. It will give you change history if available, or perhaps a list of the files contained in the dataset.</p>\n\n<p>It currently grabs metadata from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dataprotocols.org/\">DataPackages</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ckan.org/\">CKAN API</a> used by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk\">data.gov.uk</a> (and others), but it could, in theory, support any dataset representation there is.</p>\n\n<p>The end result is that we can auto-populate <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://certificates.theodi.org\">Open Data Certificates</a> given just a data.gov.uk URL, which is pretty handy. It also means that our increasingly-inaccurately-named git data viewer can load <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://git-viewer.labs.theodi.org/repositories/http%3A%2F%2Fdata.gov.uk%2Fdataset%2Fstaff-organograms-and-pay-identity-and-passport-service\">non-git datasets</a> (albeit a bit slowly).</p>\n\n<p>Data Kitten is still only a little ball of fluff, but we&rsquo;ll be nurturing it further, and if you&rsquo;d like to help it grow up into a raging data-munching tiger, consuming everything in its path, then you can join in and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/data_kitten\">contribute to the code on GitHub</a>.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/discussing-digital-democracy.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/discussing-digital-democracy","slug":"discussing-digital-democracy","title":"Discussing Digital Democracy","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:51+01:00","created_at":"2014-06-17T15:39:13+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Today I was lucky enough to visit the Houses of Parliament and take part in a roundtable discussion as part of the Speaker\u2019s Commission on Digital Democracy.

Together, we discussed how technology could increase citizen engagement, how parliamentary data could be opened up, and how technology can facilitate more interaction between citizens and Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>A few common themes rapidly emerged, around trust, communication, dialogue, and making citizens feel that they can be heard by the legislature. One good quote was \u201cpolitics in the everyday, not just once every five years\u201d, which I think encapsulates a lot of what we were trying to get across.</p>\n\n<p>I managed to get in some ideas of agile methodologies, like taking an iterative approach, being focused on user needs, and of embracing failure as an inherent part of the process. There was also the idea put across that democracy itself is never finished (much like software), and that we need to engage in a process of continuous improvement to do it right.</p>\n\n<p>The most important point we made though, in my view, was that digital democracy isn\u2019t a technology problem - that bit\u2019s \u201ceasy\u201d. Technology is just the enabler of a much more important cultural shift, and it\u2019s that cultural change that will be hardest to achieve. Opening up democracy means that legislators need to trust the public with information, need to be willing to engage in dialogue with them, and need to lose the fear of negative consequences.</p>\n\n<p>These are all inherent aspects of the Open revolution, and will be the real stumbling blocks for institutions as venerable as the British Parliament, where tradition and immutability are quite literally embedded in the architecture.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have high hopes for the outcome of this commission, based on what I\u2019ve seen today.

If you&rsquo;re interested, read on fellow techie\u2026</p>\n\n<p>The first place I looked was Chris Taggart&rsquo;s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://openlylocal.com/councils/open\">Open data scoreboard</a> on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://openlylocal.com/\">Openly Local</a>. This has a list of councils and links to their open data sections. The only problem is this relies on councils to contact Chris so he can list them, there still must be a decent amount of councils that have an open data section, but haven&rsquo;t told Chris about it.</p>\n\n<p>I used the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://openlylocal.com/councils/open.json\">JSON version of the data</a> as a starting point (which helpfully also had every other council listed, along with their website) and added them to a database.</p>\n\n<p>I then queried the database for councils without an open data section and tried adding some common suffixes for open data sections to the council&rsquo;s website domain, such as <code>/data</code>, <code>/opendata</code>, <code>/open-data</code> and <code>/transparency</code>, and seeing what the webserver returned. If any of the responses were <code>200</code> (that is, the webserver said the page existed), I added the URI to the database as an open data section for that council.</p>\n\n<p>However, after picking some of my results at random, I found that a lot of these pages, while the webserver returned <code>200</code>, they were actually &lsquo;Page not found&rsquo; pages (which should have returned a <code>404</code>). So I decided to run my queries again, but this time adding an obviously junk suffix to the domain first. If the junk one returned a <code>200</code>, I knew that this council&rsquo;s website wasn&rsquo;t set up properly and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to guess an open data section from the authority.</p>\n\n<p>I then decided it might be a good idea to see how many councils had open data sections that were accessible within two clicks of the homepage. This involved me scraping the homepage of every council website and seeing if I could find a link to the open data section. If not, I then scraped every page that was linked to from the homepage to see if I could find a link there.</p>\n\n<p>The results of my survey were that 38% of councils had open data sections that were either listed in Openly Local, or that I could reasonably guess at the URI.

It&rsquo;s great that more and more organisations are seeing that the data they hold is an asset that they can use to their benefit.</p>\n\n<p>When data is viewed in the same way as a physical product, it&rsquo;s natural to jump to selling it as a mechanism for making money. But data isn&rsquo;t a physical product. Giving other people and organisations information can help them to engage with you more efficiently, saving you money. It can stimulate demand for the tools and services that you provide. And working together on shared open data, whether it&rsquo;s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\">maps</a> or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2012/10/04/worlds-first-real-commercial-open-data-curation-project/\">legislation</a>, can improve the quality of the information you use for a fraction of the cost that it would take for you to maintain yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Business cases need to examine the overall impact of opening up data, not in terms of direct cash flow but in terms of improving the use of information within your organisation and by your customers and partners. When comparing open and charged-for data, business cases need to factor in the ongoing sales, legal and support costs that come with closed data.</p>\n\n<p>We have been working on a guide that aims to help organisations to examine the potential for opening up data they own, and put together business cases that compare different business models for data sharing.

Conventional tools such as Excel fail (limited to\u0002 1,048,576 rows), which is sometimes taken as the definition of <em>Big Data</em>. Then again, I\u0002 recently\u0002 heard one of the leading experts,\u0002 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://big-data-book.com/meet-the-authors\">Ken Cukier</a>,\u0002 say: &ldquo;there is no definition of big data&rdquo;.\u0002 </p>\n\n<p><strong>What follows is a, technical,\u0002 collection of tips. It assumes you are familiar with base R, how to install packages and how to do basic operations. Two interactive introductions to R are: <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.datamind.org/\">DataMind</a>\u0002 and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r\">Code School</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this particular case \u0002I managed to load the complete data\u0002 into RAM for a standard analysis in \u0002<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.r-project.org/\">R</a>, i.e. no \u0002Hadoop or similar. \u0002Here are 11 tips when you deal with\u0002 <strong>f</strong>\u2013ing\u0002 <strong>i</strong>rritating, \u0002<strong>g</strong>ranular data.\u0002 This blog post is about <em>Fig Data</em>: data that may\u0002 not be \u0002&rdquo;big&rdquo; but the problems of size are <em>thinly veiled</em>. I won&rsquo;t cover parallel techniques in R, but \u0002you can find a starting point with \u0002<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://r-pbd.org/\">programming with big data in R</a>\u0002 and a\u0002 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.xmind.net/m/LKF2/\">mind map</a>.\u0002 Just because you can load your data \u0002into RAM does not guarantee you a smooth workflow. Computers are powerful, but it is easy to reach their limits.\u0002 The <strong>scale factor</strong>, that is a rough estimates of the\u0002 potential time you could save, is sometimes\u0002 <em>up to 1,000\u0002</em> or even beyond. A factor of 60 means your code takes 1 minute to run \u0002instead of 1 hour.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Think in vectors.</strong> This means that for-loops (&ldquo;do this for \u0002x times&rdquo;) \u0002are generally a bad idea in R. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf\">R Inferno</a> has a chapter on why and how to &ldquo;vectorise&rdquo;. \u0002Especially if you&rsquo;re a beginner or come from another programming language for-loops might be tempting. Resist and try to speak \u0002R. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2010/08/20/a-brief-introduction-to-apply-in-r/\">apply</a> family may be a good starting point, but of course do \u0002not avoid loops simply for the sake of avoiding loops.</li>\n  <li><strong>Use the fantastic <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/\">data.table</a> package.</strong>\u0002 Its advantage lies in speed and efficiency. \u0002Developed by \u0002<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/403310/matthew-dowle\">Matthew Dowle</a> \u0002it introduces a way of handling data, similar to the data.frame class. In fact, it includes data.frame, but some of the syntax is different. Luckily, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.pdf\">documentation</a> (and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/datatable-faq.pdf\">FAQ</a>) are\u0002 excellent.</li>\n  <li><strong>Read csv-files with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/data.table/docs/fread\">fread</a> function</strong> instead of read.csv (read.table). It is faster in reading\u0002a file in table format and\u0002gives you feedback on progress. However, it comes with a big warning sign\u0002 <em>&ldquo;not for production use yet&rdquo;</em>. One trick it uses is to \u0002read the first, middle, and last 5 rows to determine column types.\u0002 Side note: ALL functions that take longer than 5 seconds should have progress bars. Writing your own function? \u2013&gt; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/txtProgressBar.html\">txtProgressBar</a>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Parse POSIX dates with the <em>very</em> fast\u0002package\u0002 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://rforge.net/fasttime/\">fasttime</a>.\u0002</strong> Let me say that again:\u0002very fast. (Though the dates have to be in a standard format.)</li>\n  <li><strong>Avoid copying data.frames</strong> \u0002and \u0002<strong>remove,</strong> <code>rm(yourdatacopy)</code>, some in your workflow. You&rsquo;ll figure this out anyway when you run out of space.</li>\n  <li><strong>Merge data.frames with the superior <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15673550/why-is-rbindlist-better-than-rbind\">rbindlist</a></strong> \u0002\u2013 \u0002data.table we meet again. As the community knows: &ldquo;<em>rbindlist</em> is an optimized version of <code>do.call(rbind, list(...))</code>, which is known for being slow when using rbind.data.frame.&rdquo;</li>\n  <li><strong>Regular expressions can be slow</strong>, too. On one occassion I found a simpler way and used the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2010-2/RJournal_2010-2_Wickham.pdf\">stringr</a> package instead; it was a lot faster. </li>\n  <li>No R tips collection would be complete with a hat tip to Hadley Wickham. Besides stringr, I point you to <strong><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/hadley/bigvis\">bigvis</a>, a package for visualising big data sets</strong>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Use a <em>random sample</em> for your exploratory analysis or to test code</strong>. Here is a code snippet that will give you a convenient <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://gist.github.com/statshero/6122484\">function</a>:\u0002 <code>row.sample(yourdata, 1000)\u0002</code> will reduce your massive file to a random sample of 1,000 observations.</li>\n  <li>Related to the previous point is <strong>reading only a subset of the data you want to analyse</strong>. <code>read.csv()</code> for example has a <code>nrows</code> option, which only reads the first x number of lines. This is also a good idea of getting your header names. The preferred option, a random sample, is more difficult and probably needs a &lsquo;workaround&rsquo; as described <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15532810/reading-40-gb-csv-file-into-r-using-bigmemory\">here</a>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Export your data set directly as gzip.</strong> Writing a compressed csv file is not entirly trivial, but <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2009/12/r-tip-save-time-and-space-by-compressing-data-files.html\">stackoverflow</a> has the answer. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2009/12/r-tip-save-time-and-space-by-compressing-data-files.html\">Revolution Analytics</a> also has some benchmark times for compressions in R.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\u0002</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Ulrich Atz","slug":"ulrich-atz","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/ulrich-atz","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Ulrich Atz","slug":"ulrich-atz","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/ulrich-atz","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/five-stages-of-data-grief.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/five-stages-of-data-grief","slug":"five-stages-of-data-grief","title":"Five Stages of Data Grief","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:07+01:00","created_at":"2013-12-03T09:46:35+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"As organisations come to recognise how important and useful data could be, they start to think about using the data that they have been collecting in new ways.

Often data has been collected over many years as a matter of routine, to drive specific processes or sometimes just for the sake of it. Suddenly that data is repurposed. It is probed, analysed and visualised in ways that haven&rsquo;t been tried before.</p>\n\n<p>Data analysts have a maxim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you don&rsquo;t think you have a quality problem with your data, you haven&rsquo;t looked at it yet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Every dataset has its quirks, whether it&rsquo;s data that has been wrongly entered in the first place, automated processing that has introduced errors, irregularities that come from combining datasets into a consistent structure or simply missing information. Anyone who works with data knows that far more time is needed to clean data into something that can be analysed, and to understand what to leave out, than in actually performing the analysis itself. They also know that analysis and visualisation of data will often reveal bugs that you simply can&rsquo;t see by staring at a spreadsheet.</p>\n\n<p>But for the people who have collected and maintained such data \u2014 or more frequently their managers, who don&rsquo;t work with the data directly \u2014 this realisation can be a bit of a shock. In our last ODI Board meeting, Sir Tim Berners-Lee suggested that the data curators need to go through was something like the five stages of grief described by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model\">K\u00fcbler-Ross model</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So here is an outline of what that looks like. </p>\n\n<h3>Denial</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This can&rsquo;t be right: there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with our data! Your analysis/code/visualisation must be doing something wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At this stage data custodians can&rsquo;t believe what they are seeing. Maybe they have been using the data themselves but never run into issues with it because they were only using it in limiting ways. Maybe they had only ever been collecting the data, and not actually using it at all. Or maybe they had been viewing it in a form where the issues with data quality were never surfaced (it&rsquo;s hard to spot additional spaces, or even zeros, when you just look at a spreadsheet in Excel, for example).</p>\n\n<p>So the first reason that they reach for is that there must be something wrong with the analysis or code that seems to reveal issues with the data. There may follow a wild goose chase that tries to track down the non-existent bug. Take heart: this exercise is useful in that it can pinpoint the precise records that are causing the problems in the first place, which forces the curators to stop denying them.</p>\n\n<h3>Anger</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Who is responsible for these errors? Why haven&rsquo;t they been spotted before?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the fact that there are errors in the data comes to be understood, the focus can come to rest on the people who collect and maintain the data. This is the phase that the maintainers of data dread (and can be a reason for resisting sharing the data in the first place), because they get blamed for the poor quality.</p>\n\n<p>This painful phase should eventually result in an evaluation of where errors occur \u2014 an evaluation that is incredibly useful, and should be documented and kept for the Acceptance phase of the process \u2014 and what might be done to prevent them in future. Sometimes that might result in better systems for data collection but more often than not it will be recognised that some of the errors are legacy issues or simply unavoidable without massively increasing the maintenance burden.</p>\n\n<h3>Bargaining</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What about if we ignore these bits here? Can you tweak the visualisation to hide that?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And so the focus switches again to the analysis and visualisations that reveal the problems in the data, this time with an acceptance that the errors are real, but a desire to hide the problems so that they&rsquo;re less noticeable.</p>\n\n<p>This phase puts the burden on the analysts who are trying to create views over the data. They may be asked to add some special cases, or tweak a few calculations. Areas of functionality may be dropped in their entirety or radically changed as a compromise is reached between utility of the analysis and low quality data to feed it.</p>\n\n<h3>Depression</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This whole dataset is worthless. There&rsquo;s no point even trying to capture this data any more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the number of exceptions and compromises grows, and a realisation sinks in that those compromises undermine the utility of the analysis or visualisation as a whole, a kind of despair sets in. The barriers to fixing the data or collecting it more effectively may seem insurmountable, and the data curators may feel like giving up trying.</p>\n\n<p>This phase can lead to a re-examination of the reasons for collecting and maintaining the data in the first place. Hopefully, this process can aid everyone in reasserting why the data is useful, regardless of some aspects that are lower quality than others.</p>\n\n<h3>Acceptance</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We know there are some problems with the data. We&rsquo;ll document them for anyone who wants to use it, and describe the limitations of the analysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the final stage, all those involved recognise that there are some data quality problems, but that these do not render the data worthless. They will understand the limits of analyses and interpretations that they make based on the data, and they try to document them to avoid other people being misled.</p>\n\n<p>The benefits of the previous stages are also recognised. Denial led to double-checking the calculations behind the analyses, making them more reliable. Anger led to re-examination of how the data was collected and maintained, and documentation that helps everyone understand the limits of the data better. Bargaining forced analyses and visualisations to be focused and explicit about what they do and don&rsquo;t show. Depression helped everyone focus on the user needs from the data. Each stage makes for a better end product.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Of course doing data analysis isn&rsquo;t actually like being diagnosed with a chronic illness or losing a loved one. There are things that you can do to remedy the situation. So I think we need to add a sixth stage to the five stages of data grief described above:</p>\n\n<h3>Hope</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This could help us spot errors in the data and fix them!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Providing visualisations and analysis provides people with a clearer view about what data has been captured and can make it easier to spot mistakes, such as outliers caused by using the wrong units when entering a value, or new categories created by spelling mistakes. When data gets used to make decisions by the people who capture the data, they have a strong motivation to get the data right. As Francis Irving outlined in his recent <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-burn-the-digital-paper-a-call-to-arms\">Friday Lunchtime Lecture at ODI, Burn the Digital Paper</a>, these feedback loops can radically change how people think about data, and use computers within their organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Making data open for other people to look at provides lots more opportunities for people to spot errors. This can be terrifying \u2014 who wants people to know that they are running their organisation based on bad-quality data? \u2014 but those who have progressed through the five stages of data grief find hope in another developer maxim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.<br />\n\u2014 <em>Linus&rsquo;s Law, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html\">The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric Raymond</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The more people look at your data, the more likely they are to find the problems within it. The secret is to build in feedback mechanisms which allow those errors to be corrected, so that you can benefit from those eyes and increase your data quality to what you thought it was in the first place.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/food-for-thought-an-opportunity-to-champion-the-next-open-data-challenge.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/food-for-thought-an-opportunity-to-champion-the-next-open-data-challenge","slug":"food-for-thought-an-opportunity-to-champion-the-next-open-data-challenge","title":"Food for thought: Opportunity to champion the next Open Data Challenge","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:48+01:00","created_at":"2014-06-12T12:45:41+01:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"The Open Data Institute and Nesta are pleased to announce a paid opportunity for an individual to support the delivery of the Food Open Data Challenge which will be launched in July 2014.

No doubt there are others that you can come up with now, and that will emerge as we move forward, but these are the four that are top of my list.</p>\n\n<h3>Free is not Always Open</h3>\n\n<p>There has been a welcome push recently to make data, particularly government data, freely available to whomever wants to use it. But making data freely available is only the first step in making it open for all to reuse. There are layers of barriers between information that anyone can get and data that anyone can use. I&rsquo;m not just talking about licenses, or the format issues addressed by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://5stardata.info/\">five stars of open data</a>, or even the community involvement tackled by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opendataimpacts.net/engagement/\">five stars of open data engagement</a>, but barriers around comprehension and access and reliability. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/coins\">COINS dataset</a> released by the government several years ago is a good example of freely available data that is essentially closed to anyone without the time, resources and expertise to comprehend it. (Fortunately there are <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.wheredoesmymoneygo.org/\">some people who do</a>!)</li>\n  <li>Datasets that are only available as batch downloads raise barriers for those who are only interested in a portion of the dataset; those that are only available through an API make accessing the entire dataset for global analysis difficult.</li>\n  <li>When organisations want to build businesses on top of open data, they don&rsquo;t just need the data itself, but also guarantees around persistence, reliability, accuracy and general ongoing maintenance that enable them to invest in it without being concerned about the world shifting beneath their feet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The star schemes and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://checklists.opquast.com/en/opendata\">checklists for open data</a> serve to highlight places where we have found that open data publication hasn&rsquo;t achieved the outcomes that we were hoping for, and ideas about what to do to address that. Which leads on to the second challenge.</p>\n\n<h3>Open is not Always Free</h3>\n\n<p>Raising the standard of open data releases, to lower the barriers for reusers of that data as described above, can be costly, and organisations are rarely motivated by benefits that come to other people. If they are going to be publish open data, they need to find an incentive to do so that is closer to home. I wrote recently about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/172\">Open Data Business Models</a> that help public sector and third-sector organisations save money and deliver on their primary task, and for-profits make money, by publishing open data. Open data does not have to be all burden and no benefit for publishers.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, where resources are limited, organisations need to choose where to invest in increasing the quality of the open data they publish. Theories about what generally makes open data useful may be <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/42075/positive-deviant\">&ldquo;true but useless&rdquo;</a> in the context of a specific organisation. Data owners need to connect directly with current and potential reusers, to understand what they need and focus on those requirements. This doesn&rsquo;t preclude unanticipated reuse, but it does help ensure that effort isn&rsquo;t <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/pdbrewer/status/245609450369605632\">wasted in development work</a> that only <em>might</em> be useful.</p>\n\n<h3>Analysis is not Always Easy</h3>\n\n<p>Open data, and the plethora of tools that make it easy to visualise, can lure us into a false sense of comprehension. We can take a list of areas with associated numbers of cancer deaths, throw them into a map and pick out the lightest and darkest areas as being best and worst. But all too often we do this without thinking about whether the differences between the figures are either statistically or practically significant.</p>\n\n<p>This matters when people make decisions based these kinds of analyses: how much money should be assigned to each area, what traffic calming facilities should be introduced, which head teachers should be sacked. Statisticians have known how to handle figures responsibly for more than a century; as open data grows up, we need to embed that rigour into the analyses and visualisations we produce.</p>\n\n<h3>Open Data is not Always Good</h3>\n\n<p>The final challenge for our aspirations for open data is that open data is purely a tool: it is not good in and of itself. Open data can help people make more informed decisions, but it can equally mislead people into making poor decisions, or enable individuals to make good decisions for themselves that, in aggregate, lead to a more divided society.</p>\n\n<p>I recently read <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Everything-Obvious-Common-Sense-Nonsense/dp/184887216X\">&ldquo;Everything is Obvious&rdquo; by Duncan J. Watts</a>. He talks about the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/salganik_dodds_watts06_full.pdf\">Music Lab experiment</a>, in which users of an online music store were able to rate and download music tracks, and others see the aggregated ratings of each track. As expected, some tracks were vastly more popular than others. The twist of the experiment was that it was run in eight parallel networks, each with exactly the same songs, and in each world the final ratings of the songs were vastly different: each world had a different track that was vastly more popular than all the rest. Users would choose to listen to songs with higher ratings, and rate those more highly themselves, leading those same songs to get even better ratings, and so on, a feedback cycle leading to a popularity measure whose relationship to the actual musical quality of the track was almost non-existent.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem much of a stretch to imagine that the same pattern applies to making data available about pupil attainment, say:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>parents make decisions about what school to send their children to based on pupil attainment scores</li>\n  <li>those who can afford to move house to have more of a chance for their children to attend a good school</li>\n  <li>these richer parents spend money on tutoring, on school trips, on extra-curricular activities and so on; the school has more resources to spend on the children</li>\n  <li>the children do better at school</li>\n  <li>the school&rsquo;s pupil&rsquo;s attainment marks go up</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Run the cycle a few times and some schools blossom while others nose dive. We don&rsquo;t have the luxury of running this in eight parallel worlds, but it&rsquo;s not hard to see how initial minor deviations between schools can be exaggerated through this feedback cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Open data can be a powerful force for social, environmental and economic change, but we shouldn&rsquo;t be blind to the fact that it can lead to bad outcomes as well as good &ndash; or even no changes at all! We need to be clear about the goals that we want to achieve when we release open data, and monitor the impact of open data towards those goals, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/test-learn-adapt-developing-public-policy-randomised-controlled-trials\">preferably experimentally</a>, to build our evidence base.</p>\n\n<h3>Meeting the Challenges</h3>\n\n<p>With these challenges on my mind, I am really delighted to be taking up the position of Technical Director of the Open Data Institute. I am looking forward to addressing the challenges by</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>studying and spreading the word about open data successes and failures, to help us all learn from each other</li>\n  <li>helping data reusers to innovate around open data to drive good decision making</li>\n  <li>helping data owners to publish their data in ways that maximise the benefits to themselves, the reusers of their data, and society as a whole</li>\n  <li>contributing to the development of tools, services and standards to support this work</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Most of all, I am excited about working with the open data community to magnify the impact of their extensive work on the individual concerns of new and existing businesses and public-sector organisations. We are as yet a small team at ODI, but it&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;m already proud to be part of.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/french-president-talks-open-data-with-odi-paris-and-odi-supporter-snips-at-exclusive-honorary-lunch.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/french-president-talks-open-data-with-odi-paris-and-odi-supporter-snips-at-exclusive-honorary-lunch","slug":"french-president-talks-open-data-with-odi-paris-and-odi-supporter-snips-at-exclusive-honorary-lunch","title":"French President talks open data with ODI Paris and ODI Supporter, Snips, at exclusive honorary lunch","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:10+01:00","created_at":"2014-04-25T10:07:54+01:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/about-nodes.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/about-nodes","slug":"about-nodes","title":"Nodes","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:54+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-23T12:22:16+01:00","tag_ids":["page"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/node-knowledge-november-2013.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/node-knowledge-november-2013","slug":"node-knowledge-november-2013","title":"Node Knowledge\u2026 November 2013","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:26+01:00","created_at":"2013-11-18T17:58:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014","slug":"odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014","title":"Node knowledge - Feb 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:38+01:00","created_at":"2014-02-22T21:35:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"FivebyFive, the Open Data Institute\u2019s Paris \u2018Node\u2019, and Snips, an ODI Supporter have today (25th April) been recognised as leading lights amongst France\u2019s new wave of open data entrepreneurs.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, ODI CEO Gavin Starks and FivebyFive\u2019s Kat Borlongan all spoke at the conference about the potential for open data, and the importance of openness and transparency.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, ODI CEO said</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Open data in France has taken a huge leap forward this week. Today\u2019s Presidential event with ODI Paris and Snips, and the fact that France has joined the OGP, show that the French government is acting to catalyse the huge business opportunities that open data can bring; to drive open innovation and better services for French citizens.

It&rsquo;s a big step forward for FivebyFive, as a young startup, to be invited to sit down with the President over lunch and not just tell him but show him what we mean. It sends a strong signal to the open data community as a whole and makes us even more hopeful for the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rand Hindi from Snips said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is a real honour to be invited to discuss such important topics with the French President. As a startup specialising in modelling how people and cities interact, we rely heavily on open data to build contextual models of urban environments. We can already predict passenger flow in public transport, car accidents and crime. The more data we can access, the more problems we can solve, thus contributing to making cities a better place to live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"News: French President talks open data with ODI Paris and ODI Supporter, Snips, at exclusive honorary lunch","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[{"name":"Paris","slug":"paris","level":"city","beta":true,"web_url":"http://theodi.org/nodes/paris"}]},"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[{"name":"Paris","slug":"paris","level":"city","beta":true,"web_url":"http://theodi.org/nodes/paris"}],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/from-seoul-to-osaka-asia-pacific-opens-arms-to-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/from-seoul-to-osaka-asia-pacific-opens-arms-to-open-data","slug":"from-seoul-to-osaka-asia-pacific-opens-arms-to-open-data","title":"From Seoul to Osaka - Asia Pacific opens arms to open data as ODI announces five new international Nodes","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:33+01:00","created_at":"2014-02-17T11:39:20+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/node-knowledge-november-2013.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/node-knowledge-november-2013","slug":"node-knowledge-november-2013","title":"Node Knowledge\u2026 November 2013","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:26+01:00","created_at":"2013-11-18T17:58:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-global-network-announced.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-global-network-announced","slug":"odi-global-network-announced","title":"ODI global network announced","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:41+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-28T19:20:44+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"The ODI has announced five new international Nodes including the first two from the Asia Pacific region: Osaka, Seoul, Sheffield, Philadelphia and Hawaii.

Each Node will catalyse open data culture within their own communities and communicate open data success stories globally.

The venue was the Open Data Institute\u2019s new offices in Shoreditch. The challenge was to use open data to make something that would help people get fitter or healthier.</p>\n\n<p>To meet this challenge we brought nothing but an open mind (and a few gadgets). Our team was made up of Farzana Dudhwala (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/fuz_d\">@fuz_d</a>: a pioneering health and wellbeing researcher), Prashant Khare and Aashish Doon (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/mail2prashant\">@mail2prashant</a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/AashishDoon\">@AashishDoon</a>: maverick software developers) and Ian Rodgers (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/igpr2\">@igpr2</a>: a creative IP lawyer). We came together on the Saturday morning having been united by a common lack of ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anyone for tennis?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Five minutes before we had to submit our projects, however, Farzana shared a problem. She\u2019d been trying to find somewhere to play tennis (and a partner to play it with) but had been having difficulties. We agreed that we could do something to help. So we put forward an application that solves this problem as our idea.</p>\n\n<p>Our dataset was made available by Spogo (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://spogo.co.uk/developer-area\">https://spogo.co.uk/developer-area</a>). It provides high quality data on sports venues (a quick comparison shows that it\u2019s up to 15 times better than Google Maps at finding tennis courts near a given postcode). \u0002\nDuring the weekend, with a combined sleep time of around 11 hours between the four of us, we identified the relevant fields and processed them into a useable format. Then, we built a web based application that matched our user\u2019s preferences with others who have similar preferences to suggest a mutually convenient venue for their chosen racquet sport. Finally, we put together a presentation that explained what we had done and why.</p>\n\n<p>**Go-Hit-It-Off **</p>\n\n<p>Our project was called \u2018Go-Hit-It-Off\u2019.\u0002It got some really good feedback, with a lot of people showing interest in the application and the concepts behind it. We faced some pretty intense competition, but in the end, it was our idea that hit-it-off with the judges and we were the overall winners! Its success, we think, goes to show what can happen when open minds and open data are put together.</p>\n\n<p>We don\u2019t know where this is going next. To be honest, since the weekend, we\u2019ve all been pretty busy just catching up on some sleep! We\u2019re planning on getting together in the next week though, and we\u2019ll be thinking about how best to take up the offer of desk-space at the ODI. We\u2019ll be working on making sure that the code is as elegant as possible and we\u2019ll spend some time on improving the user interface. For this, I\u2019m sure that the health-accelerator mentoring will be very useful. \u0002We\u2019d like to thank the ODI and everyone who made the weekend possible. We had a great time and are really proud of what we achieved.</p>\n\n<p><em>Go-Hit-It-Off present their ideas to UK Government Ministers at The ODI\u2019s opening event in December.

This is where the tech team comes in.\u0002As part of sprint #4\u0002we were tasked with building an app to allow members to see, at a glance, what spaces were booked, and for how long.</p>\n\n<p>On the surface, this looked like a simple task. We use Google Apps for all our internal email and calendaring, so it should have just been a case of pulling an iCal feed out of Google Calendar, and\u0002into the app.</p>\n\n<p>However, a bug in Google Calendar meant that we couldn&rsquo;t get public iCal feeds for the pods and meeting rooms (called &lsquo;resources&rsquo; in Google Apps), and time being of the essence, we couldn&rsquo;t wait for it to be fixed.</p>\n\n<p>Another problem was testing our code - in my previous role, I worked on my own and checked my code by literally testing an\u0002app in my browser before I pushed it to live. However, as we are starting to move towards <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery\">continuous deployment</a> at the ODI (that is, our code gets tested and pushed to live every time we push it to Github), we need to make sure we write tests for our code.</p>\n\n<p>Ordinarily, this isn&rsquo;t a problem. We use <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cukes.info\">Cucumber</a> to write a load of expectations and then test these expectations\u0002by querying the database, spinning up a virtual browser, or recording a HTTP interaction. If the tests pass, the code gets deployed. However, as the plugin we wanted to use was javascript-based it\u0002caused\u0002us problems running automated tests in\u0002<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://jenkins.theodi.org\">Jenkins</a>\u0002(normally, if we want to test Javascript, we have to spin up a real browser,\u0002like Chrome or Firefox.)</p>\n\n<p>These obstacles meant that, as is often the case in software development, what looked like a simple task actually became a bit more complex.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing I had to do was look at the Google Apps API. The normal process for connecting to the API (and most of the examples I saw), involved a user authenticating against their account in a web browser and then the app pulling out their data. As we only wanted to pull data out of the ODI account, and there was no front end user interaction, the use case was rather different.</p>\n\n<p>I eventually <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://code.google.com/p/google-api-ruby-client/wiki/ServiceAccounts\">found the solution</a>, and with bookings being pulled into my app quite happily, I got onto testing my code.</p>\n\n<p>In my former job, I&rsquo;d played a bit with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://phantomjs.org/\">Phantom.js</a>, which is a fully functional web browser, without one crucial thing - a window. This is immensely powerful stuff, and means you can do anything you can do in a normal browser by issuing a few Javascript commands. It&rsquo;s great for web scraping, automating things like form submissions (I used it in my old job to automatically upload reports submitted in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ratemyplace.org.uk\">Ratemyplace</a> to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ratings.food.gov.uk\">Food Standards Agency ratings site</a>), and yes, testing!</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.pezholio.co.uk/2013/04/automated-testing-with-cucumber-and-phantom-dot-js/\">I blogged about this in more detail on my personal blog</a>, but suffice to say, it worked perfectly, and I&rsquo;m hoping to find more excuses to use this technology in the future.</p>\n\n<p>You can see the final results at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://office-calendar.theodi.org\">office-calendar.theodi.org</a> and see the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://github.com/theodi/office-calendar\">source code here</a>. At the moment, you can only view bookings, but we&rsquo;ll be looking at allowing members to book space online.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, we&rsquo;ll also be using the data generated by the app to build <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://shopify.github.io/dashing/\">awesome dashboards</a> for our Commercial Team to see how the space is being used. In the coming weeks, we&rsquo;ll be using a lot more of the data generated by our external and internal apps, and publishing more data on things like our members and events, so watch this space!</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Stuart Harrison","slug":"stuart-harrison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-harrison","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Stuart Harrison","slug":"stuart-harrison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-harrison","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/git-data-publishing.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/git-data-publishing","slug":"git-data-publishing","title":"Git for Data Publishing","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:47+01:00","created_at":"2013-05-20T10:35:06+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"Over the last few years, open source software developmenthas been revolutionised by the adoption of distributed version control systems.

This has lowered the bar for\u0002participation, and has had an incredible impact on the quality and range of open source output, and enabled fantastic service ecosystems and business models to build up.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, open data is still its infancy as far as tooling and process go.\u0002In a world where open data is published sporadically, where it&rsquo;s hard to get things fixed, and where publishers aren&rsquo;t recognised or able to easily engage\u0002with their user community, can the tools of open source revolutionise open data publishing in the same way?</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I believe this is possible. Data is different from code in many ways, but the open source development model has a lot we can learn from. When I can fork your open dataset, fix errors, and easily get my changes integrated back in, we all win.\u0002\nWe could sit down and discuss this for a while; there are certainly lots of issues to think about. However, I&rsquo;m a hacker at heart, and I think best when my mind can express itself through working code. So, in my 20% time at work, I&rsquo;ve been experimenting.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly: we can put simple data into GitHub repositories, but it&rsquo;s not very friendly, so\u0002I&rsquo;ve built a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://git-viewer.labs.theodi.org/\">Git Data Viewer</a>, which wraps around a git repository (not necessarily GitHub), and exposes some information about the contents in a more data-user-friendly way than the standard GitHub view. Currently, if you create a repository, add some data in CSV, and add a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.okfn.org/standards\">DataPackage</a> file to describe it, the app can load that up\u0002and show you the details, contents, history, and so on of that dataset. For example, here is a view of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://git-viewer.labs.theodi.org/repositories/git%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdatasets%2Fhouse-prices-uk.git\">UK house price dataset</a>, which was put onto GitHub by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://rufuspollock.org/\">Rufus Pollock</a>. As you can see, it&rsquo;s substantially friendlier than the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/datasets/house-prices-uk/\">bare repository</a>\u0002(though data.okfn.org does also provide <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.okfn.org/data/house-prices-uk\">a more useful view</a> of this particular dataset).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;ve started experimenting with the process of maintaining and improving this data. I&rsquo;ve uploaded an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/dataset-mod-disposals\">MOD dataset</a> to play around with; here you can see an\u0002<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/dataset-mod-disposals/pull/1\">open pull request</a> for an improvement to the file format of the data. I&rsquo;m already learning that while many operations on datasets match well with Git, some do not. Adding columns, for instance, affects every line, so will be very difficult to merge in if other things have changed as well. I&rsquo;m unsure at the moment if this is a fundamental limitation in Git itself, or whether we can improve the tooling to make this easier.</p>\n\n<p>I make no claim that this will work, it&rsquo;s an experiment to see which bits do and which bits don&rsquo;t, and to see how far we can push our current toolset before it breaks.

The first programme has the theme of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.f6s.com/crimejusticeimmersionprogramme\">Crime and Justice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Last Wednesday, 20th March, we kicked off with a day long session at the Open Data Institute where we discussed what three challenges should be set for participants in the programme. The day was arranged and co-hosted by Olivia Burnam from the ODI, who will continue supporting the programme when she returns to the Cabinet Office next month.</p>\n\n<p>Olivia and I were keen that the discussion concentrated on real issues that people involved in the crime and justice sectors want tackling. One of the advantages of having an extended length of time to create projects is that we are able to talk about what open data projects might usefully do rather than focus on what we can create from the available data from the start.</p>\n\n<p>So, we started off with a brief discussion about what we meant by Crime and Justice and what we thought was in and out of scope when setting the challenges. \u0002\nWe followed on from this with a range of debate that included the fears and aspirations that data publishers had when publishing open data; the current situation with open data releases and projects developed from them; what developers were interested in as well as what they are currently involved in and finally we discussed what the challenges could be.</p>\n\n<p>From all of that we narrowed down three challenges that we are setting for people to tackle. They are:</p>\n\n<p>How can open data projects be constructed that achieve one of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>increase community involvement with the criminal justice system?</li>\n  <li>create further evidence for what are effective interventions for rehabilitation?</li>\n  <li>address the rise in personal crime?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/content/open-data-immersion-programme-crime-and-justice-challenge-definition-day-minutes\">attendee list and minutes</a> from Wednesday are both available. I&rsquo;ll also be adding more resources that help people understand the programme and how to get involved over the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>We are aware that while we had a strong attendance both from people working within the public sector and open data developers we were unsuccessful in our attempts to invite civil society groups. This includes those operating in the areas of crime prevention and victim support as well as services for prisoners and their families. Campaigning groups were also not represented. I&rsquo;d be really interested in hearing the opinions and ideas from such organisations and I&rsquo;ll be actively seeking those out over the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>The process for taking part as an open data developer in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.f6s.com/crimejusticeimmersionprogramme\">Crime and Justice Immersion programme</a> is still open. Now that the challenges have been decided and published I hope more people will apply to take part.

Hopefully, you\u2019ll stop and reassess those 0s and 1s and see the significance of data. This is exactly what I have been doing at Deloitte Analytics in London for the last four months.</p>\n\n<p>At Deloitte, we delved through thousands of datasets, interviewed businesses and explored the latest digital trends surrounding open data. Open data is not just a short-lived phenomenon but is here to stay as governments across the world release their data online. We have sought to understand which industries benefit most from the data and what governmental datasets are advantageous to which industries. We have also created different business models to display the numerous ways open data is being reused.\u0002Further understanding of such new trends can only maximise the effectiveness of businesses, developers and organisations utilising open data.</p>\n\n<p>In the current economic downturn, open data can be a critical catalyst in helping businesses to make the right decision and for entrepreneurial developers to feed off each other and the reams of untapped potential of sites like data.gov.uk. The digital economy beckons to be a new route for the UK out of the recession. With so much knowledge, talent and expertise across the UK\u2019s tertiary and quaternary sectors, open data can be the resource to fuel growth. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century it was coal that powered industrial growth in Victorian Britain, in the \u000221<sup>st</sup> century it can be open data that fuels a digital economy. \u0002To give you a snapshot of just some of the potential benefits of using open data in the private sector, consider examples from the insurance, real estate or customer services industries.\u0002For instance: insurers could make more accurate assessments of claims; real estate companies could better understand planning issues; and, companies could provide more bespoke, customer-focussed products with increased efficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to go from here?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Data released must be more standardised in format to give the user the best possible chance to extract information. The data must also be accurately recorded by hubs, so they know how much unique information they hold. Also, open data must be palatable and useful to the user.</p>\n\n<p>Businesses need to be more proactive and realise the advantages of opening up their data. Working on the Deloitte report has shown me how interwoven businesses\u2019 destinies and operations are. Even competitors in the same industry have more to gain by publishing open data than guarding silos of often unused data.\u0002\u0002\u2018No man is an island\u2019 should perhaps be altered to \u2018no business is an island\u2019.</p>\n\n<p><em>Mike Warren was seconded to Deloitte to work on joint research examining the open data market</em></p>\n\n<p><em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/news/uk-leads-demand-open-data-odi-opens-business\">Read more</a> about the ODI/Deloitte research</em></p>\n\n<p><em>See the<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/market-insights/deloitte-analytics/open-data/bfb570a79416b310VgnVCM1000003256f70aRCRD.htm\"> full research</a></em></p>\n\n<p>\u0002</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Mike Warren","slug":"mike-warren","web_url":"http://theodi.org/mike-warren","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Mike Warren","slug":"mike-warren","web_url":"http://theodi.org/mike-warren","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-data-mixology.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-data-mixology","slug":"guest-blog-data-mixology","title":"Guest Blog: Data mixology","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:37+01:00","created_at":"2013-03-27T16:16:07+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"For many years of my life my inbox was a post-apocalyptic wastescape of noise, corporate spam and information overload to the point of near migraine status.

As a result of this directive, a new era of open government in the U.S., as well as the resulting open data, began in earnest. Fast forward a few years and the Internet is awash with official websites, PDFs, APIs and all manner of methods designed to let me engage and participate with data, not opinion.</p>\n\n<p>However, while the availability of open government data trended sharply upward, I began to get the sense that its potential was being restricted. The data itself was great. But there seemed to be few tools that allowed me to refine the huge amount of data into information I actually cared about. Furthermore, I often spent an inordinate amount of time learning jargon and technical language to even mildly grasp what I was reading. The data was expansively raw. Unrefined. Or perhaps\u2026an ingredient ?</p>\n\n<p>Theo Priestly wrote <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/big-data-you-dont-need-a-data-scientist-you-need-a-data-plumber-0268818\">an interesting piece</a> on the notion of a \u201cdata plumber.\u201d The point he makes is that the nature of \u201cBig Data\u201d is to be like water. It is alive, flows from place to place, changes and grows.

Per the opening, we spent the beginning of our professional lives mired in data deserts where perspective and opinion dominated the landscape. After that, we found ourselves afloat on a sea of open data with no way to reasonably drink what we wanted. We knew that if we could take the raw ingredients provided by open data, refine, distill and mix them in way that people wanted, we would be on to something. Today, our users order up government data feeds in a way that is both useful and shall we say, thirst-quenching.</p>\n\n<p>The open data movement in government has undoubtedly made great strides in fostering transparency, participation and collaboration. While there is still a ways to go, it can be said that the raw materials upon which to build companies are present. From here forward, it is the job of citizens, whether for-profit or not, to take those ingredients and make the experience of understanding a government as simple a buying a pint.</p>\n\n<p><em>Nate Nash is the CEO of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://govtribe.com/\">GovTribe</a>, a company focused on taking open government data and making it useful for normal people.</em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Nate Nash","slug":"nate-nash","web_url":"http://theodi.org/nate-nash","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Nate Nash","slug":"nate-nash","web_url":"http://theodi.org/nate-nash","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-focus-45-return-investment.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-focus-45-return-investment","slug":"guest-blog-focus-45-return-investment","title":"Guest Blog: Focus on a 4.5 return on investment","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:30+01:00","created_at":"2013-03-04T16:16:58+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"Music 4.5 is turning 3 years old this week.

During the last few years Music 4.5 has become an established part of the London tech scene. The series of events was started with a passion for helping start-ups and investors connect, while working and sharing more closely with artists.</p>\n\n<p>It all started out with an observation that there was an ever-increasing number of music-tech startups trying to solve different parts of the music industry conundrum, and yet there was a lack of connection and understanding between the music and technology industries. The gap in the market was obvious: something needed to be done to get music geeks and tech geeks and entrepreneurs talking to each other. These were the early days of streaming, when Spotify&rsquo;s business model was still interesting (and mysterious). It was still early days for music and technology actually engaging with each other.</p>\n\n<p>After many discussions over strong cups of Nordic coffees Rassami Hok Ljungberg, who has a background in communications, and Petra Johansson, who is an events organiser, decided on an action plan. They were going to try to bridge the gap between the music people and the tech entrepreneurs by creating a series of events that would bring them together to get talking about the issues and focus on how to achieve a fair-share return on investment. The events would help everyone examine new trends in the industry and, most importantly, get techies and music industry people talking with each other. I then\u0002came on board as a blogger and journalist, documenting the lessons learned.</p>\n\n<p>Three years later there are ever more events, focusing on more than just music start-ups. The 2Pears (yes, that&rsquo;s Rassami and Petra) also run pitch training workshops in collaboration with UKTI, the Music TechPitch 4.5 and TechPitch 4.5 events, where start-ups from across all of Europe pitch their business idea to a panel of judges in 3 minutes sharp.</p>\n\n<p>The 4.5 in all the event names is derived from a Web 2.0 philosophy which says\u0002that, after the huge losses incurred on Web 1.0, the ambition for web enterprises is to make money and achieve a 4.5 times return on investment (ROI). In the music and technology business landscape this means a 4.5 times ROI for all parties: artists, entrepreneurs and investors. The 2Pears events are all about helping companies make money.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe want to provide a forum for a productive discussion between different industries and communities, stimulating new connections and conversations, and hopefully helping to spark new ideas and ways of making money for startups, investors and artists\u201d, says co-founder Rassami H\u00f6k Ljungberg.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s important to us that we empower tech entrepreneurs to gain awareness, learn from each other as well as from failures, and ultimately succeed.

During our first day of planning, we set out our strategy for selling data at a margin, where we could build the business and move forward. We then released a dataset that Blair spent a lot of sweat and tears over, which has already been successfully shared with a number of customers \u2013 at no charge.</p>\n\n<p>The dataset is the full set of GB postal sector boundaries, which are used in everything from defining media boundaries and store delivery areas to web map searching, analysing customer data and producing a wide range of maps for public consumption.\u0002Blair has used an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://geolytix.co.uk/blog/?p=17\">innovative methodology</a> to build these sectors which we believe makes them the best in the market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The open data vision</strong></p>\n\n<p>Making the decision to release the dataset at no charge was actually very simple, and one that Blair and I came to independently.\u0002Blair had decided over a coffee with Steven Feldman of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/\">KnowWhere Consulting</a>, while I had spent a great 5 months working with the Open Data User Group. Thanks to Steven\u2019s support, and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/odug\">Open Data User Group</a>,\u0002Blair and I came to the conclusion, and hope that many other start-ups will pursue the same direction.</p>\n\n<p>So why have we decided <em>to make #opendata</em>, something that can sell for many thousands of pounds? There were many reasons;</p>\n\n<p>1.\u0002\u0002\u0002We believe in the vision of #opendata, and how it can make the world a better place.</p>\n\n<p>2.\u0002\u0002\u0002We still need to earn a living. Our vision is that both the updates and additional services based on our open data have real value we can sell. By sharing our #opendata, and providing updates that cost ~10% of similarly-priced competitor offers, we think of our #opendata as the ultimate \u2018free evaluation\u2019. We believe we have built a better mouse-trap, what better way than to give every potential user in the world the chance to test it at no charge?</p>\n\n<p>3.\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002A head-to-head battle to oust incumbent suppliers, by mimicking their business model would take too long, involve far too much effort and would be unlikely to succeed. The incumbency advantages are simply too large. Most postal boundary data is bought wrapped up with other datasets, software and solutions. Each victory for us would be long and hard-fought and involve high selling costs.</p>\n\n<p>4.\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002Although we\u2019re providing #opendata, the IP remains ours, meaning that when people use it they have to attribute Geolytix as the source. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if one of the big guys started using it ? Imagine every web map search having to name-check little old us!</p>\n\n<p>5.\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002Reputation matters. My experience in business does not support the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_intro\">Ayn Rand world view</a> that rejects ethical altruism. Rather my experience has been that over time people and organisations build a \u2018goodwill bank\u2019 through their own behaviour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Growing passion</strong></p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ll have to be in it for the long haul, as many of our potential customers will be locked in to multi-year deals. We know there is a growing network of people who are passionate about #opendata. Over time they will become, and increasingly influence, those who hold the purse strings. We\u2019re also hoping that offering a Freemium model will encourage the smaller guys to realise the benefit of location analysis. One or two of them will be happy to pay for the updates, but more importantly it can help grow the whole location analysis industry.\u0002I\u2019m looking forward to seeing if this can form a solid business model for the future \u2013 I have a good feeling it can.  </p>\n\n<p>*Sarah Hitchcock is an ODUG member and joined GeoLytix in October after 11 years working in the Network &amp; Investment Planning team at Sainsbury\u2019s. *</p>\n\n<p><em>GeoLytix was formed by Blair Freebairn in 2011, and is a consultancy focussing on Solving Problems where Location Matters.\u0002</em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://portal.mxlogic.com/redir/?aqdT7CkTQjhOrjhKUOYYUyCr01AvGumD8fWRuraVF2HsPt-j79zANOoVcsrKrFIt9YjBeNeRr5gkh-FVqsw_HlVIGrjvd7ar9J5BZAQsIL3AjhOrjvdyVx18Qg6aNgEq87qNd415LWjd410-F4TfM-u0USMrodFETvKMeupodx_ufoGFaXrbo\" title=\"https://portal.mxlogic.com/redir/?aqdT7CkTQjhOrjhKUOYYUyCr01AvGumD8fWRuraVF2HsPt-j79zANOoVcsrKrFIt9YjBeNeRr5gkh-FVqsw_HlVIGrjvd7ar9J5BZAQsIL3AjhOrjvdyVx18Qg6aNgEq87qNd415LWjd410-F4TfM-u0USMrodFETvKMeupodx_ufoGFaXrbo\"><em>http://geolytix.co.uk/about</em></a></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Sarah Hitchcock","slug":"sarah-hitchcock","web_url":"http://theodi.org/sarah-hitchcock","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Sarah Hitchcock","slug":"sarah-hitchcock","web_url":"http://theodi.org/sarah-hitchcock","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-honest-buildings-joins-odi-start-ups.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-honest-buildings-joins-odi-start-ups","slug":"guest-blog-honest-buildings-joins-odi-start-ups","title":"Guest Blog: Honest Buildings joins ODI start-ups","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:10+01:00","created_at":"2013-02-26T13:01:42+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"We are absolutely thrilled to have been selected as a startup to be incubated at theOpenDataInstitute.

We should listen to the voices of internal experts \u2013 they know what works. I think there is a real opportunity here, if the traditional suspicions over public and private partnerships can be lessened.</p>\n\n<p>And secondly, I was very concerned about the lack of understanding about data standards. The link between having lumps of meaningless open data, and new jobs and better services, lies in open data standards. A technical, dry perhaps even nerdy subject \u2013 but nonetheless just as essential as making public sector data open. Data standards exist solely to give meaning, or taxonomy, to the information held in every database. These taxonomies can be mapped together even if the data is federated and in disparate formats. In other words, interoperability and re-usability increases by connecting datasets together for others to interpret and extract valuable information.</p>\n\n<p>**Police database warrants new prescription for NHS **</p>\n\n<p>Smart application of data standards is exactly what has enabled 43 police forces to create a single national police database designed to catch criminals who would \u0002otherwise be partially invisible. If the police can access federated databases for criminal intelligence, then other public services can do the same. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/news/prescription-savings-worth-millions-identified-odi-incubated-company\">recent work by Mastadon C and Open Health Care UK</a> proves this. Their analysis of doctor&rsquo;s prescribing habits demonstrated that the NHS could make significant savings if cheaper generic alternatives were used instead of more expensive, branded, drugs. The NHS could increase value for money by mapping clinical health codes.</p>\n\n<p>I believe government\u2019s fundamental role in open data is to enable the flow of knowledge from open data by improving the ease and cost of access. In no small part this involves enhancing skills in government, encouraging the reuse of open data by openly publishing its own data standards so that skilled data experts can develop exactly the types of new products and services that the open data policies are designed to achieve.\u0002\nThe ODI has already begun to make headway in these important areas but there is a lot of work to do. This could start with all ICT based Government procurement tenders automatically including the associated code list and data standards used by the procurement department.</p>\n\n<p>The open data agenda is substantial and far reaching and responsibility for success cannot rest solely with those in charge of policy, or with the ODI that is striving to catalyse the open data sector.\u0002As the biggest creators and curators of data, central and local government has to be the starting point for a thriving digital economy fuelled by open data. But as this new research demonstrates, sustainable success \u2013 new jobs, better services and lower cost IT implementation over the long term \u2013 will require much deeper and wider engagement across the public sector and for the private sector\u2019s potential to be embraced.</p>\n\n<p><em>The research was conducted in late December 2012 by Dods, on behalf of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.listpoint.co.uk/media\">Listpoint.</a> More than 1000 responses were received across central and local government, non-departmental bodies, the NHS and police forces.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Dermot Joyce is CEO of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.liberata.com/home\">Liberata</a>, the IT company that runs Listpoint</em></p>\n\n<p>\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Dermot Joyce","slug":"dermot-joyce","web_url":"http://theodi.org/dermot-joyce","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Dermot Joyce","slug":"dermot-joyce","web_url":"http://theodi.org/dermot-joyce","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-increasing-supply-public-sector-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-increasing-supply-public-sector-open-data","slug":"guest-blog-increasing-supply-public-sector-open-data","title":"Guest Blog: Increasing the supply of public sector open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:18+01:00","created_at":"2012-11-04T17:41:17+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The Open Data User Group (ODUG) met recently at the Open Data Institute to talk about the ideas submitted via a form on Data.gov.uk for data that should be released for free.

They expect this re-use will contribute to economic growth, better social outcomes, illustrate government\u2019s performance and/or create greater efficiencies within government.  </p>\n\n<p>In New Zealand one outstanding example of this innovative re-use is the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.anz.co.nz/commercial-institutional/economic-markets-research/truckometer/\">ANZ Truckometer.</a> This is a set of two economic indicators developed by ANZ Bank economists using traffic volume data from around the country. They use traffic flows as a real-time and real-world proxy for New Zealand economic activity, where a large proportion of freight is moved by road.  </p>\n\n<p>ANZ Bank carefully analysed the open traffic density data released as an API by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nzta.govt.nz/\">New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA)</a>, selected key routes and applied statistical techniques to smooth out anomalies and gaps.<br />\n The result is a strong correlation between traffic flows and predicting economic growth or decline as measured by GDP data from Statistics New Zealand. The ANZ Heavy Traffic Index shows a strong contemporaneous relationship to GDP, while the ANZ Light Traffic Index has a six month lead on activity as measured by GDP.  </p>\n\n<p>Snappy monthly ANZ Truckometer reports present the results graphically and have traffic-related titles like Pedal to the metal, bumpy road, and engine braking. The July 2013 report On ice, reports that \u201cThe ANZ Light Traffic Index\u2026 is predicting three consecutive quarters of positive GDP growth for the remainder of the year, averaging around a 3\u00bd percent annual pace. That\u2019s healthy, particularly when compared against OECD peers\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>The ANZ economists note that \u201cThe contemporaneous relationship between heavy traffic and GDP is not surprising \u2013 road user charges revenue data have long been used as an economic indicator. Trucks are moving produce, after all. But the lead to GDP provided by the light traffic flows is more surprising. It would appear that willingness to buy and drive a car is the ultimate measure of \u201cmoney-where-your-mouth-is\u201d consumer confidence\u2026service vehicles (courier vans, for example), which are also captured in this data, may also be a leading economic indicator\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>NZTA has also benefited from this unexpected re-use of their data. The process has helped identify and fix errors in the data, and a potentially major benefit for NZTA is that the ANZ has shown that carefully selected light traffic flows can be used to forecast NZTA\u2019s road user charges revenue six to seven months ahead.

For this reason our early focus has been on transport due to the rapid progress in data releases in this sector, and because there is a lot of scope for adding value. More or less all the key transport datasets and live data streams have now been released in Britain, and this has enabled us to create the<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://developer.transportapi.com/\"><u> Transport API</u></a>platform, on which we have built and monetised a variety of services. This experience has taught us several lessons, with implications for other new open data businesses and for government policy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finding value</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The first lesson has been that open data must be able to produce value in all the usual ways e.g. solving problems, increasing convenience or saving money. Placr has been trading as a pure open data business now for 18 months and so we have been able to produce value for both businesses and consumers. For example, we have seen that the re-packaging of open data from a variety of sources into a single coherent service has value&hellip;and we now have more than 100 developers signed up on<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://developer.transportapi.com/\"><u> Transport API</u></a>. We have also seen that real-time access to open data streams allows insights into the operating practices of the data producer. These insights have allowed us to develop expertise in those practices via the data, and therefore, to offer value back to the operator. Open data also offers value by dramatically cutting the cost of products and services based on it. Viewed from this perspective open data can best be understood as a market disruptor, which can help liberalise the way many markets work.  </p>\n\n<p>In transport the disruptions of integration, insight and cost reductions have given Placr opportunities to create new services and compete with existing suppliers. In transport,\u0002the value proposition of many operators suffers by comparison with the most agile sectors e.g. retail. Hence, transport operators have a limited relationship with their customers, they offer largely supply-driven services, and the customer service is often poor. Placr has been innovating around customer relationships, service metrics and user feedback using our open data<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://developer.transportapi.com/\"><u> Transport API</u></a>platform to power new apps like<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://uktraveloptions.com/\"><u> UK TravelOptions</u></a>or alerting services like<u>[Tube Radar](http://apps.placr.co.uk/transportapi/tube/about)</u><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://apps.placr.co.uk/transportapi/tube/about\">.</a>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>New vs mature markets</strong></p>\n\n<p>A second lesson we have learned working close to the data releasing process is the important difference between operating in an early market with new data streams (such as live London Bus departures) and entering mature markets occupied by newly liberalised data monopolies (such as National Rail Enquiries). Early markets have huge potential, however, they require marketing investments to reach the new audiences, and the margins can be small given the pricing and competition e.g. in app stores. Our approach in this environment has been to partner with developers who can produce great user experiences with our validated and scaled open data feeds. For example, Placr has partnered with the CityMapper team to supply tailored bus and train feeds to their<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://busmapper.co.uk/\"><u> BusMapper</u></a> and<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://citymapper.com/\"><u> CityMapper</u></a> apps, which are now among the most popular travel apps in London.  </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, entering a mature market still dominated by a former monopolist such as National Rail Enquiries requires investment to match the incumbent and define new market segments that the monopolist has never served. Placr&rsquo;s<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://developer.transportapi.com/\"><u> Transport API</u></a> platform is the first independent source of train service timetables/live departures in Britain that is available as a developer feed, and complements several excellent open source web sites such as<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opentraintimes.com/\"><u> OpenTrainTimes</u></a>. Our approach in this environment has been to build capacity in previously unserved market segments such as specialised journey planners e.g.<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.getmetomyflight.com/\"><u> getmetomyflight</u></a>, while developing some new propositions previously prevented by monopoly terms and conditions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mixology</strong></p>\n\n<p>A third lesson has been that there are significant challenges in remixing open data and commercially licensed data. Open data released under the Open Government Licence (or similar public domain licence) are free of charge and cannot have their use constrained. By contrast, the cost of using commercially licensed data is significantly raised by the legal costs of licensing advice. You also have to be able to specify your business model in advance of signing a licence and you have to commit to a royalty level in advance. Digital data businesses need to experiment with data re-use models and often need to pivot their business when a particular re-use gains traction e.g. on an app store.  </p>\n\n<p>If you want to change usage of commercially licensed data, then often a rights-holder will want to raise the price, look for a share of the revenue or prevent you developing the idea (so they can do it themselves). While<u>[Transport API](http://developer.transportapi.com/)</u> is a licensed data platform, Placr only charges for volume and service guarantees&hellip; and does not seek downstream ownership of the supplied data when monetised. Placr&rsquo;s business model is to develop our platform as a distribution channel and collaboration environment, and to build our own propositions there alongside our partners.  </p>\n\n<p>Placr&rsquo;s continues to focus on the liberalised open transport sector, and we have moved into The Open Data Institute to take advantage of the incubation opportunities here. We are delighted to be here at The ODI and we have already benefitted from the steady flow of visitors who we either pitch to&hellip;or who challenge us!

Easy money does not get much easier than this.</p>\n\n<p>But perhaps it just sounds too good to be true.</p>\n\n<p>And maybe that is why the plate remains untouched, and the benefits are slowly evaporating.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are these savings, how can they be achieved and what needs to change to make it possible?</p>\n\n<p>The answer starts in the schedule of government ICT contracts that are up for renewal between now and 2016, and add up to \u00a326 billion across more than 200 projects.</p>\n\n<p>On any ICT renewal programme, the cost of integrating data that is located across federated databases is significant. As much as 12.5% of the overall cost.</p>\n\n<p>So imagine the savings that can be achieved if you can completely avoid much of that time and cost. Imagine that \u00a3650 million \u2013 savings that are immediate and not dependent on the promise of future efficiency gains. That is money that could be immediately redirected into front line services, or go towards the deficit.</p>\n\n<p>This is all very real, very practical and easy to achieve.\u0002\n<strong>True meaning of open data</strong></p>\n\n<p>All it needs is for the true meaning of open data to be adopted \u2013 for the code lists and data standards that go with government data to be made open so they can be re-used and recycled.</p>\n\n<p>By reusing and mapping code lists, the time and money spent on data integration can be cut by 20% - or 2.5 percentage points of the whole job. They are as essential as the data itself.</p>\n\n<p>The upside for the IT integrator in taking this approach lies in doing the right thing by their customer and by the UK taxpayer \u2013 and one would have thought that would be a big enough incentive these days.</p>\n\n<p>But access to those code lists and data standards is closed off.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.data.gov.uk/\">Data.gov.uk</a> is the place to go for open datasets. But if you search for \u2018reference data standard\u2019 \u2013 you get zero. Search for data standard, you get one item returned. Search for code list \u2013 and you get 1200 returns. There are over 9000 datasets tipped into data.gov.</p>\n\n<p>This lack of data standards produces technical and cost constraints which mean the reuse and inter-operability of open data are curtailed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Barriers to entry</strong></p>\n\n<p>Without the data standards, ideally accessible online in a machine readable format, the open data community has no choice but to spend scarce time and resources manually interpreting and mapping the data taxonomies. This creates a significant barrier to entry for those that are SME companies and entrepreneurial start-ups, and inflates the costs from the larger players.\u0002\nThis upfront investment, which is entirely avoidable, even acts as a disincentive to invest R&amp;D budgets in open data initiatives.</p>\n\n<p>So, what\u2019s the answer?</p>\n\n<p>This government has done more than any other <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-transparency-and-accountability-of-government-and-its-services\">to push forward transparency and create the environment for a new digital economy</a> to develop. But these remain tantalising prospects of jam tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Government can gain immediate benefits, and further its open data agenda, by adapting the current definition of open data to include the data standards used in codifying it.\u0002Devoid of its standards, open data is not open.</p>\n\n<p>Such a change in definition and approach would produce immediate benefits to the open data community at large and savings to the government.\u0002\nData standards that are easily accessible and open serve to align the open data strategy with the Cabinet Office\u2019s mandate to reduce public procurement of software.\u0002\n<strong>Publication of data standards</strong></p>\n\n<p>By publishing the data standards in government tender documents, the IT vendors would be required to reuse rather than replicate (at taxpayer expense) existing and functioning data standards. \u0002\nOur experience with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.listpoint.co.uk/2012%20Police%20National%20Database%20case%20study.pdf\">Police National Database</a> programme demonstrates this can be done.

As with other kinds of open data, OpenStreetmap is enabling innovation in new and unexpected ways, and a flourishing ecosystem in which companies large and small, as well as university students, and bedroom coders, are all collaborating or competing on a level playing-field.</p>\n\n<p>At the hack weekend we had a broad spectrum of people with different interests and skills.

A couple of examples stood out for me: Andy Allan is currently making a living selling consulting services around OpenStreetMap. In particular he sets up stylesheets (cartographic design) and the rendering and tile serving servers needed to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.thunderforest.com\">supply stylised maps to the web</a>. This kind of custom cartography is not possible with google maps, since it requires access to raw map data. At the weekend Andy gave a workshop on the basics of designing map styles using <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://mapbox.com/tilemill/\">TileMill</a>. This is one of many tools developed to work with OpenStreetMap data. TileMill is open source, but created by a commercial company, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://mapbox.com\">MapBox</a>, who have a business selling OpenStreetMap rendering and hosting services.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/OpenStreetMaps3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>We had a presentation from Ben Abelshausen, of a tool called <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://osmsharp.codeplex.com\">OsmSharp</a> which he has developed, and which is now being used by a logistics company to plan the routes for all of their deliveries. He couldn&rsquo;t even begin to develop this kind of powerful custom routing software without access to raw map data.  </p>\n\n<p>Besides these sessions we also hacked upon various developments aimed at making OpenStreetMap bigger and better and most of all easier.

Think of \u2018a Facebook for things\u2019 where individual objects, like the products in our lives, have a unique online profile (like we all do), which can be updated, shared and added to. Data about products will be able to be manually or automatically updated via sensors attached to the objects. Thus we get objects which can make suggestions to users based on anything, like location or time of day - pretty much whatever you can imagine. This information is delivered dynamically to consumers when they \u201ccheck in\u201d to the products by scan/swiping with their smartphones.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.snapfashion.co.uk\">Snap Fashion</a> is another great innovation born here in Britain, invented and developed by 25-year old computer science graduate, Jenny Griffiths, one of only two girls in her class of 30 at the University of Bristol. \u0002The Snap Fashion phone app allows users to photograph any item of clothing to find suitable matches which they can buy. The photographed item is searched for on Snap Fashion\u2019s extensive list of affiliates via cut, colour, and style, and the results are delivered straight back to the user. Users can browse all, save favourites to buy later, or click through directly to the retailer\u2019s website to buy an item there and then.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.inputdynamics.com\">InputDynamics</a> has developed software to make smart-phones smarter. TouchTap software adds a new button \u2013 the \u2018Big Fat Soft-Key\u2019 - anywhere on the casework without the need for new hardware. It gives users new, flexible ways to interact with their handsets \u2013 including while their phone is in their pocket. TouchTap extends touch beyond the screen to the entirety of the case and makes it easier to input text and commands as well as enhancing the user interaction with applications and games.</p>\n\n<p>These are just a few illustrations of the fantastic digital innovations coming out of the UK. Through identifying collaboration, investment or international trade opportunities at Innovate UK it is hoped that more businesses like these will be able to accelerate growth. At similar events last year (the Technology Strategy Board\u2019s Innovate and UK Trade &amp; Investment\u2019s TechWorld), businesses generated over \u00a370m worth of UK trade as a direct result of attending; 65% identified new business opportunities and 77% said they learned something that would help them to innovate.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to be part of the conversation around innovation and to benefit from similar investment and trade opportunities <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.innovateuk2013.co.uk\">visit us here</a>\u0002for more information</p>\n\n<p><em>Iain Gray is the CEO of the Technology Strategy Board</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The ODI will be attending and exhibiting at Innovate UK 2013 on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.innovateuk2013.co.uk/agenda/agendabydate\">Tuesday 12th March 2013</a></em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Iain Gray","slug":"iain-gray","web_url":"http://theodi.org/iain-gray","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Iain Gray","slug":"iain-gray","web_url":"http://theodi.org/iain-gray","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-open-data-blues-and-twos.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-open-data-blues-and-twos","slug":"guest-blog-open-data-blues-and-twos","title":"Guest Blog: Open Data Blues and Twos","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:39+01:00","created_at":"2013-04-10T18:13:32+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The ODI isrunning a programme using open data to help tacklecrime and rehabilitate offenders.

We think that there are a lot of other benefits to be had from taking part though, and there are some great opportunities for having the development of your ideas supported by the series.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next few months participants will be working towards the Creation and Innovation Weekend at the end of June. Here they will need to produce their open data project and a business plan that demonstrates how they will be able to make money from their idea. It&rsquo;s during this development period that I&rsquo;ll act as a go-between for requesting data, accessing expert advice and making connections to people in the ODI who can help participants achieve these goals.</p>\n\n<p>So, applying to participate could get you access to some help from me, but also to resources and expertise to help you get your project off the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Teams who are successful at the Creation and Innovation Weekend, and these are not necessarily just the ones winning prize money, will have the chance of entering the ODI&rsquo;s Start Up Programme. This programme is part of the ODI&rsquo;s mission to incubate new businesses and create economic growth through the use of open data.</p>\n\n<p>Put simply, the ODI has a mission to make at least some of these businesses a success. If you are successful at the Creation and Innovation Weekend you could be one of them.</p>\n\n<p>If this has piqued your interest then you can go and sign up immediately on the<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.f6s.com/crimejusticeimmersionprogramme\"> ODI Immersion Programme</a> pages. I&rsquo;ll be contacting all of the current applicants over the coming week to discuss their projects with them and how I can help them.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there are a couple of Hackathon events going on at the end of the month that will be of interest, both to people already signed up and to those who want to find out some more.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blc13-eorg.eventbrite.com/\">BlueLightCamp Hackathon</a> is happening on Sunday 28th April in Manchester. This is being organised by friends Sasha Taylor and Mark Braggins and I&rsquo;m very pleased to have been asked to host the event. This is an excellent opportunity to find out more about the Immersion Programme, test out some ideas and potentially form teams.</p>\n\n<p>As well as hosting, I&rsquo;ll be happy to advise people on the sort of open data projects they could develop and take forward on the Immersion Programme.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://c-100.org/hack/index.html\">Hack The Police</a> is a hackathon which is on the same weekend in London.

The panel was chaired by\u0002Stephan Shakespeare, head of the Data Strategy Board and CEO of YouGov.</p>\n\n<p>The event began with presentations by Gavin Starks, CEO of the ODI and a number of ODI incubator companies to explain how they use open data in their businesses. One message that came up repeatedly was how open data today is in a similar position to how the web was back in 1995, except the infrastructure in place to support growth is much better.</p>\n\n<p>After the presentations Stephan opened the discussion to the floor and asked \u201cWhat should be the national strategy for open data?\u201d Lively debate then ensued around the question of the government\u2019s role in open data. Should they release data or develop it (or a hybrid of both)?</p>\n\n<p>The general feeling in the room was that the key responsibility of government should be to create a level playing field for both public and private sectors by making data available to both sectors simultaneously and preventing preferential access by government departments as this was stifling competition. The private sector businesses didn\u2019t have a problem with the public sector also utilising data to create products and applications but they felt that, in some fields, they had a large \u2018first mover\u2019 advantage which couldn\u2019t be overcome. The transport sector was cited as good example of an area in which all the data had been made available to a wide range of participants and it was encouraging development and competition.</p>\n\n<p>The other big issue that the room felt passionately about was the lack of a clear channel through which to escalate open data requests and issues. There was a desire for a system similar to how the Freedom of Information requests operate in which there is a formal channel for any citizen to use to request the release of an open data set. This would then act as the mechanism which held the relevant government departments accountable for their decisions around open data. Stephan stated that this \u2018Right to Data\u2019 concept would be a key recommendation in his report.</p>\n\n<p>I personally came out of the event feeling more optimistic about the challenges facing open data. Whilst there are still issues to address there are also increasing examples of best practice and what can be achieved when open data is handled well. Like the web in 1995, there\u2019s all manner of unknowns but the potential benefits that could be unlocked are only limited by our imaginations.</p>\n\n<p><em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/consultation-response/independent-public-sector-information-review\">Read a report </a>about the Open Data Market Makers event</em></p>\n\n<p>\u0002</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Mark Goodhead","slug":"mark-goodhead","web_url":"http://theodi.org/mark-goodhead","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Mark Goodhead","slug":"mark-goodhead","web_url":"http://theodi.org/mark-goodhead","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-open-and-linked-data-recipe-refreshed-public-services-and-better-businesses.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-open-and-linked-data-recipe-refreshed-public-services-and-better-businesses","slug":"guest-blog-open-and-linked-data-recipe-refreshed-public-services-and-better-businesses","title":"Guest Blog: Open and Linked data - a recipe for refreshed public services and better businesses.","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:10+01:00","created_at":"2012-11-13T13:35:03+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The UK Government Linked Data Working Group (UKGovLD) met last week for an enlightening and diverse session of presentations highlighting the mix of Linked Data projects across the public sector.

In addition, UKGovLD will engage with broader users, potential users and re-users of Linked Data, working directly or through organisations like The ODI. It will reach out to organisations and individuals with an interest in using or increasing the use of Linked Data or finding out how the approach can help with a particular business need.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of the working group we have established a delivery team that will help in driving forward the agenda.\u0002\n<strong>The value of Linked Data</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the first questions I\u2019m asked\u0002if I mention Linked Data is \u201chow will it benefit me ?\u201d.\u0002For me, the answer is clear but it began with a journey that started 4 years ago when I attended a very compelling presentation by John Sheridan at the National Archives on their use of Linked Data. It chimed with me and helped draw out some issues around integrating data across and within organisations.</p>\n\n<p>We had been developing very similar ideas in the geospatial community and were interested in doing things differently to join up across government. Linked Data provides a vital step in moving towards a data-centred transformation, where we have a platform of open data (both public and non-public) with web APIs and application services developed around these that deliver real efficiencies in the public sector.\u0002Linked data provides a very flexible data structure that is designed for repurposing. And the use of open data standards and open source tools ,along with a flexible underlying data structure has enabled a number of projects to be delivered in an agile and sustainable way that keeps costs a lot lower than traditional delivery methods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>New business practices</strong></p>\n\n<p>With growth as well as savings being a particular concern at the moment the case for departing from historical business practices is very strong. From my work in bringing the Linked Data approach to the Environment Agency it\u2019s not hard to see how the savings and benefits that we have made scale up across government.\u0002We have been able to provide information in a way that serves multiple purposes. Even with our first (bathing water) project we had changing requirements that previously would have been costly and problematic to meet mid-project.\u0002This time, it was easily accommodated and you can now <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://environment.data.gov.uk/lab\">see abnormal recordings alongside our normal monitoring data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important that we make the interface as simple as possible for users.\u0002Advising a\u0002Linked Data approach in the background does not mean that everyone would be expected to use only RDF (Resource Descriptor Framework - one of the foundations of Linked Data).\u0002Instead, the approach that is emerging (and which was championed at the meeting last week) is for ease of access through APIs that sit on top of that well-structured data. Vast data projects tend to have real problems in implementation especially if we deal with them as monolithic projects.\u0002One of the huge advantages of Linked Data approaches is that everything can be broken down into smaller parts and grown sustainably.\u0002Having the underling threads of linked data in the information that lies beneath the surface will enable successful businesses (like those working with The ODI) to be built on top of open data.</p>\n\n<p>\u0002\n*Alex Coley is the UKGovLD Working Group Chair and a staffer at the Environment Agency *</p>\n\n<p><em>The UK Government Linked Data Working Group is on twitter <strong>@UKGovLD</strong> and you can read more details about registering as a member and the work of the Group **<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.data.gov.uk/linked-data/UKGovLD\">here</a></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/linked-data/UKGovLD\">full terms of reference for the UKGovLD</a></em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Alex Coley","slug":"alex-coley","web_url":"http://theodi.org/alex-coley","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Alex Coley","slug":"alex-coley","web_url":"http://theodi.org/alex-coley","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-opening-local-government-spending-was-it-worth-it.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-opening-local-government-spending-was-it-worth-it","slug":"guest-blog-opening-local-government-spending-was-it-worth-it","title":"Guest Blog: Opening up local government spending - was it worth it?

As part of the push to transparency, all English local councils have been asked to publish all their spending over \u00a3500 online on a monthly basis. These \u2018swift and simple changes\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-era-of-transparency-will-bring-about-a-revolution-in-town-hall-openness-and-accountability--2\">could</a> \u2018revolutionise local government\u2019 and \u2018unleash an army of armchair auditors\u2019, with citizens analysing the data and holding their local councils to account.</p>\n\n<p>For the last year I\u2019ve been researching the impact of the publication, using a combination of surveys, FOI requests and interviews. I\u2019m asking whether making this new financial information available has had an impact: are members of the public using the new information to make local government more accountable? Do they to participate more in local politics? Do they understand more about their local council?</p>\n\n<p>The evidence to date shows a limited number of people are looking at the information. A mixture of journalists, local activists and a few citizens are using the data to hold councils to account and there have been some stories in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/revealed-how-greater-manchester-councils-852837\">local press</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/council-spending/8542676/Council-credit-card-spending-database-released.html\">national press</a>. There are a few armchair auditors appearing around the country such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://armchairauditor.onthewight.com/\">here</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.upnorthauditor.com/\">here</a> (especially, as Eric Pickles pointed out, in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2011/jul/07/eric-pickles-praises-barnet-bloggers\">Barnet</a>) but it takes time, resources and interest \u2013something not many of us have.</p>\n\n<p>There are obstacles. The data itself isn\u2019t as informative as it could be, and it can\u2019t yet be compared with other councils or give a full picture of what is being spent and how (see your own local council site-mine is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.canterbury.gov.uk/media/622045/July-2013.pdf\">here</a>). Some councils <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/163-17-7m-details-released-public/story-12563395-detail/story.html#axzz2fiHC7HWs\">are not convinced</a> that the public will spend their time looking through spread sheets. When you contact your council it\u2019s generally for amenities or services-bins or planning-rather than spending.</p>\n\n<p>To make it more complicated the spending data is also very political: it isn\u2019t clear exactly what the government wants to see and they are sending out \u2018mixed messages\u2019. Some feel the information, at a time of severe cuts, is intended to make councils look like reckless spenders or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/council-spending/8829271/Council-chief-executives-spending-on-expenses-and-credit-cards.html\">wasters</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The lack of use and obstacles does not mean the reform has failed. Far from it. Councils can see the benefits of all this information for both citizens and for themselves. It is very early days and the real changes will arrive when new applications such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://openlylocal.com/\">Openly Local</a> or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.appgov.org/apg/la/localgov\">app.gov</a> (still in development) allow you to quickly search the data, compare spending with other councils and join it up with other \u2018local\u2019 information.

That&rsquo;s why we have a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/national_infrastructure_plan2011.htm\">national infrastructure plan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What we need now is a similar infrastructure for information, that will offer a relatively inexpensive additional way of both growing the economy and supporting public needs.</p>\n\n<p>The government&rsquo;s open data initiative has already made major steps in providing greater access to the wealth of public sector information through the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/nov/01/open-data-institute-information-technology?INTCMP=SRCH\">open data initiative</a>. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/appsi%5Cdefault.htm\">government&rsquo;s advisory panel on public sector information</a> (APPSI) has supported these developments, but its members, drawn from the business, academic, ICT, legal and public sector communities argue that we need a more strategic approach to how public sector information should be reused.</p>\n\n<p>It has now summarised its views on what should be done in a discussion paper\u0002entitled A National Information Framework for Public Sector Information and Open Data.</p>\n\n<p>This paper says success requires far more than simply releasing raw data on to the web. In the first instance, clarity is needed on what is the role of government in the information economy. Is it simply a provider of &ldquo;fuel&rdquo; for businesses in the UK and outside to exploit? Or should government seek to generate revenue from licensing and adding value to raw data?</p>\n\n<p>APPSI members believe there is one category of government data which should certainly be freely available \u2013 &ldquo;core reference datasets&rdquo;. Standardising information such as addresses into a single set of data would provide big safety and efficiency benefits. There is a paradox at present, in that some of the most useful data produced in the public sector \u2013 considered by many as core reference datasets \u2013 is charged for and this limits the scale of standardisation possible.</p>\n\n<p>Another area that must be addressed is the issue of anonymised, confidential personal data. . Failure to do so will limit highly valuable medical and other research, and adds unnecessary burdens on recipients of government questionnaires.</p>\n\n<p>Across the UK as a whole there is a real shortage of the information management and analytical skills needed to maximise the benefits of public sector information. This will require longer term action, including changes to the school and undergraduate curriculum \u2013 some of which is already being discussed.</p>\n\n<p>We in APPSI believe what we need to tackle all these different factors is a National Information Framework. This would be based on agreed objectives and priorities for public sector information and span central and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/local-government\" title=\"More from guardian.co.uk on Local government\">local government</a>, the NHS and the devolved administrations.</p>\n\n<p>We do not pretend this would be easy: things are changing very rapidly in the use and re-use of both public and private sector data. But we believe there is much to gain from having a clear framework that will provide as much continuity and predictability as possible to encourage businesses to invest.</p>\n\n<p>*David Rhind is is the Chair of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/appsi%5Cdefault.htm\">Advisory Panel on Public Sector Information</a>. *</p>\n\n<p>*Hugh Neffendorf is Founder and Managing Director of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.katalysis.com/pages/about.htm\">Katalysis</a>,\u0002a management consultancy that specialises in information and technology. *</p>\n\n<p><em>This blog originally appeared in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/nov/23/open-data-national-information-framework\">The Guardian Public Leaders Network</a></em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"David Rhind and Hugh Neffendorf","slug":"david-rhind-and-hugh-neffendorf","web_url":"http://theodi.org/david-rhind-and-hugh-neffendorf","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"David Rhind and Hugh Neffendorf","slug":"david-rhind-and-hugh-neffendorf","web_url":"http://theodi.org/david-rhind-and-hugh-neffendorf","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-odi-s-first-incubator-business-pioneering-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-odi-s-first-incubator-business-pioneering-open-data","slug":"guest-blog-odi-s-first-incubator-business-pioneering-open-data","title":"Guest Blog: The ODI\u2019s first incubator business on pioneering open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:06+01:00","created_at":"2012-11-01T18:30:46+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"We live in a world which is increasingly defined by data.

So what\u2019s not to like?</p>\n\n<p>But why bother to make data open?</p>\n\n<p>There are a bunch of political and philosophical reasons, but there is also one very big and very concrete reason, speaking as someone who tries to extract insight from data for a living: it\u2019s hard to know, when you first get a dataset, what the value of it might be. There\u2019s always a period of experimentation, in which you try looking at it from different angles, matching it up with some different things, and analysing it using different tools. Sometimes the most exciting, glamorous dataset turns out to be relatively boring because there\u2019s nothing you can find beneath the surface. On the other hand, dull and straightforward data can become something special when looked at through a novel analytical lens, understood by a domain expert, or combined with some other dataset which adds new layers.</p>\n\n<p>If data is closed, that experimentation period can be sadly truncated. Only a couple of individuals inside an organisation\u2019s walls get to do any of that experimentation, and the data only gets to be combined with other data and domain knowledge that are also already inside those walls. In a closed world, most data never encounters the analyst and the context that will really make it live and breathe.</p>\n\n<p>We got a nice example of this recently, tinkering around together with a large set of open government data. Our initial intent was pretty idle: I wanted to stress-test our technology platform by throwing a big set of data at it and doing some big calculations at random. But by combining our data crunching skills with interesting questions and insights from some domain experts about how this particular part of government works, we\u2019re now looking at mapping and identifying government savings opportunities on a huge scale. The exact details are under wraps for the time being, while we cross-check everything, but it looks like we\u2019ve come across something genuinely very valuable.</p>\n\n<p>Without data being open, we as a company would never have been able to even start experimenting and learning about it, and we\u2019d never have had the chance to build up its value and then give that back to users. We\u2019re now looking at turning this into some real and very interesting products, all because the openness of data made the friction low enough to try some new approaches out.</p>\n\n<p>I think this shows the very real value of open data, and also shows why we\u2019re very pleased and proud to be the Open Data Institute\u2019s first incubation company.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Francine Bennett","slug":"francine-bennett","web_url":"http://theodi.org/francine-bennett","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Francine Bennett","slug":"francine-bennett","web_url":"http://theodi.org/francine-bennett","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-web-was-designed-documents-it-was-not-designed-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-web-was-designed-documents-it-was-not-designed-data","slug":"guest-blog-web-was-designed-documents-it-was-not-designed-data","title":"Guest Blog: The Web was designed for documents, it was not designed for data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:26+01:00","created_at":"2013-02-15T15:18:55+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"HTML and other related Web technologies were initially developed to allow for the publication of natural language documents on the Internet, for reading by humans.The key phrase in the previous sentence is \u201cfor reading by humans\u201d.Humans are very good at reading natural language documents and interpreting meaning.Computers on the other hand, while they are good at serving these documents, are very bad at reading them and interpreting them.Computers require precise instructions: if you want a computer to do something for you, it is better that you have data rather than documents.

We are on the brink of using it to power and fuel a genuine, permanent transformation in how public services are designed and provided.</p>\n\n<p>This really matters to the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG).\u0002We are pushing forward with new policies which shift decision-making power from central government to local councils, their residents and local communities. The Department wants to put communities in charge of planning, increase local accountability, and help citizens to see how their money is being spent in the local area.\u0002\nOpen data is an essential ingredient of success here. It will provide the information people need to understand, compare and contrast local public services, and get involved in shaping and directing local priorities.\u0002\n<strong>Making progress: work to date</strong></p>\n\n<p>We want to get to a world where all data is available by default, in a fully open and accessible form. Our users want to quickly and easily find and re-use DCLG\u2019s outputs.\u0002It should also be possible for them to automatically join up our data with related sources, over the web:\u0002for instance, to bring together local and national sources about a particular locality.</p>\n\n<p>Like all other public-sector organisations, the challenge for DCLG is to unlock data in myriad of different formats and IT systems. Just visit our website, and you\u2019ll find a mountain of spreadsheets that are largely disconnected, and so quite difficult to bring together and re-use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First steps</strong></p>\n\n<p>Clearly, there is no magic-bullet solution, and we can\u2019t solve it overnight.\u0002\u0002My approach is instead to move progressively towards open data \u201cnirvana\u201d.\u0002This will involve working closely with users, focusing on giving them the right data, in the right form, at the right time.\u0002\nOf course, every journey starts with a single step (or two). To date, we have delivered a couple of key things:</p>\n\n<p>The first is the <strong>\u201c</strong>proof-of-concept\u201d Open Data Communities <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatacommunities.org\">site</a>.This brings together a selection of statistics on housing, homelessness, local government finance, deprivation, and wellbeing. We have also re-used extensive geographic information from Ordnance Survey and the Office for National Statistics.</p>\n\n<p>The site currently provides 74 datasets, all in 5-star linked-data formats and fully accessible via an open, standards-based API.\u0002\u0002\nOpenDataCommunities is proving itself as a means to quickly and easily join-up related datasets using links within the data, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A London Borough was chosen by the Department of Health as one of eight national pilot sites to raise awareness of certain cancers. In order to target particular households, they used OpenDataCommunities to link postcodes to the index of multiple deprivations (IMD), and understand which households resided in the most deprived local communities.</li>\n  <li>A leading national cancer hospital used postcodes and IMD scores to understand the relationships between home/community environment and the success of palliative care when researching the factors affecting place of patients\u2019 death.</li>\n  <li>A community interest company launched a fund to provide loans to community owned renewable energy projects. They used IMD and postcode data to meet their investors\u2019 requirement to support projects in the 50% most deprived areas in the UK.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Through working closely with these and other users, we have also captured other benefits like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Helping users to reduce the time, cost and complexity of acquiring and re-using multiple DCLG datasets;</li>\n  <li>Creating opportunities to quickly and easily combine DCLG data with related 3<sup>rd</sup> party data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Demonstrations</strong></p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve also produced various demonstration applications that show how linked-data can help us and our users to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Bring together DCLG sources to achieve rapid, innovative re-use.\u0002\u0002See our demonstration <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/dashboard\">Local Authority Dashboard</a></li>\n  <li>Produce more intuitive, engaging analysis and insights.

If those criteria weren\u2019t enough, it had to fit into a slightly abnormal space in our 1950\u2019s style kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>At the time I believed that anything could be found on the web. It\u2019s true for some things \u2013 if you know *exactly *what you\u2019re looking for. But try querying \u201crefrigerator black French door bottom-freezer internal water dispenser less than 68 inches\u201d with your favorite search engine. Done? I\u2019m guessing what was returned was probably not the result that would lead you to an easy purchasing decision. It certainly wasn\u2019t in my case, and led to some real headaches that resulted in hours of web search and many unnecessary trips to a number of stores.</p>\n\n<p>This frustration, plus the desire to lower the barriers to finding the right products has led the BBY Open Team within Best Buy in the direction of open product data. It\u2019s the main driver of our latest effort to build a Product Insight Engine, codename: Metis. In December 2012, we published our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://bbyopen.com/announcing-bbyopen-metis-alpha-best-buy-product-catalog-semantic-endpoints\">entire active product catalogue</a> and made it available for public consumption and linking.</p>\n\n<p>\u0002A thriving environment of linked open product data can enable deep product <em>discovery</em>, which is good for both buyer and seller. Most of us only get a narrow view of the products available to us. Important details critical in making the best purchasing decisions can disappear because of outside influences, or artificial limitations placed on product data (marketing, search engines, etc.). There is a massive product landscape available to consumers today, and we are seeing just a small portion of it. The parts that we are seeing can be heavily weighted, obfuscated by unreadable markup, or marred with inconsistencies and errors.</p>\n\n<p>To supporters of open data, open product data is music to your ears. But when asked by the business side of the house, I still struggle with the question: <em>why</em>? Let\u2019s take a look at it from a seller\u2019s perspective first. For many shop owners and retailers, the majority of their profit is made from a small minority of products. Every company is looking for growth; sell more products, increase margin and comps, plus limit the amount of product returns. These important tasks are becoming increasingly difficult in an age of razor thin margins, fierce competition, and hundreds of billons of dollars in product returns.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/KristinWomack.jpg\" alt=\"Sales Graph\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Illustration credit: Kristen Womack, https://twitter.com/kristen_womack</em></p>\n\n<p>The good news is there is room to grow through exposing open product data on the web. The illustration above represents a seller\u2019s product long tail, with the head representing the small amount of the most popular products. If we generously apply the Pareto principle, aka, the 80-20 rule, it still leaves a lengthy long tail\u2014the large majority of a seller\u2019s products are undiscovered and undersold. In a world of open product data, product catalogs would be published in a way that humans and machines can have access to every detail of a product or service. Product graphs could then be traversed and explored to discover new products or reveal those that have been hidden from view. All this exploration and discovery can grow the head and body of the seller\u2019s product long tail, resulting in additional revenue and growth.</p>\n\n<p>Of course we can\u2019t forget about the consumer side of open data. When sellers publish product data in ways that are open, discoverable, and linkable, it enables technologies to come and make sense of all of it for the good of us customers. Sellers and product manufacturers can partner to link data sources together to provide the best, most consistent data to enable the correct product selection. I can think of a time in the near future when I may need to replace another household appliance. With a solid foundation of open product data I will be able to submit a complex product query (e.g., \u201cshow me all black Energy Star certified clothes washers with at least 3 cubic feet capacity that are less than 42 inches in height and are on sale\u201d) through an application built on top of this rich web of open data, and get exactly the information I need to make the best purchasing decision for me.</p>\n\n<p>This view of smarter commerce is well within our reach. As stewards of open data we can steer business, technology and consumers in the direction of a thriving open product marketplace where both buyers and sellers win.</p>\n\n<p><em>Jay Myers is the Emerging Platforms Product Manager in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bestbuy.com\">BBY Open group\u0002</a></em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jay Myers","slug":"jay-myers","web_url":"http://theodi.org/jay-myers","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jay Myers","slug":"jay-myers","web_url":"http://theodi.org/jay-myers","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-where-are-armchair-auditors.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-where-are-armchair-auditors","slug":"guest-blog-where-are-armchair-auditors","title":"Guest Blog: Where are the Armchair Auditors?","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:49+01:00","created_at":"2013-06-01T21:24:47+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"In this blog, Ben Worthy examineswhether David Cameron\u2019s vision for a citizen army holding the public sector to**account has materialised.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p><em>In this blog, Ben Worthy examines\u0002whether David Cameron&rsquo;s vision for a citizen army holding the public sector to**\u0002account has materialised.</em></p>\n\n<p>One of the most eye-catching ideas from the government\u2019s Transparency Agenda is that of the \u2018Armchair Auditor\u2019. Armchair Audit is a form of \u2018crowd sourced\u2019 accountability where citizens use newly \u2018opened up\u2019 information on spending, contracts and crime to hold public bodies to account. But has it happened?</p>\n\n<p>David Cameron hoped a critical mass of citizen watchdogs would become a new force for accountability.\u0002As he <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pms-podcast-on-transparency\">put it</a> a \u2018whole army of effective armchair auditors looking over the books\u2019 would act as a check on \u2018waste\u2019. \u0002Citizens being \u2018able to see how your taxes are being spent\u2019, \u2018judge standards in your local schools and hospitals\u2019 and \u2018find out just how effective the police are at fighting crime\u2019 would drive better performance and efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the emphasis has been financial and local due to the publication of local authority spending over \u00a3500 (see this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=bfad418d-1be8-43c8-bb9a-40faf3d41b82&amp;groupId=10171\">LGA survey</a> for background). Eric Pickles put it bluntly-the data would \u2018unleash an army of armchair auditors and quite rightly make those charged with doling out the pennies stop and think twice about whether they are getting value for money\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the army has not appeared, as the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20221398\">BBC pointed out</a>. This is not to say there are no auditors. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://headlinedata.com/projects/armchair-auditor/\">Adrian Short</a> has created an open access software taken up by Auditors in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.upnorthauditor.com/\">\u2018North\u2019</a> (Hull and Lincolnshire) and on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://armchairauditor.onthewight.com/\">Isle of Wight</a>. In London one particularly high profile case led to Eric Pickles publicly praising Armchair Auditors in their fight against Barnet\u2019s \u2018easycouncil\u2019-see this account <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2011/jul/08/mrs-angry-how-to-be-an-armchair-auditor\">here</a>. Journalists offered <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://davidhiggerson.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/council-spending-data-10-tips-for-journalists-looking-for-stories/\">tips</a> and ran <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/revealed-how-greater-manchester-councils-852837\">stories</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/grassroots/2011/02/hull-east-riding-councils-publish-spending.html\">Taxpayers Alliance</a> promoted it as a grassroots weapon.</p>\n\n<p>But this vanguard shows little sign of becoming a citizen audit army. There are a number of reasons for this, some obvious, some less so.</p>\n\n<p>The first and most obvious barrier is the information. It is not yet consistent so questioning and understanding it is not easy or possible. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2010/nov/24/armchair-audit-sorting-fact-from-fiction\">Reluctant</a> Armchair Auditor and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubacc/102/10204.htm\">Public Accounts Committee</a> have expressed concern at the quality and comparability of information. This may improve in the future, as this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/armchair_audits\">FOI response from DCLG</a> suggests, with new applications making it easier to compare.</p>\n\n<p>The second obvious point is that to be an Armchair Auditor you need to be a particular type of person. Politically, you need to be engaged and interested in local government, understand how local government works and have a driving reason to dedicate yourself to it. To have all these traits in combination is rare-the public are, by most measures <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://hansardsociety.org.uk/blogs/parliament_and_government/pages/audit-of-political-engagement.aspx\">less engaged</a>, though there may be glimmers of hope for local government. Add to this the time and the need to access technological know-how and this narrows down the potential pool of Armchair Auditors to a select few. Even then there is no guarantee as this would- be-but-frustrated Auditor <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://richardosley.wordpress.com/2011/03/22/my-life-as-an-armchair-auditor/\">explains</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The third barrier is what you do with the information. Like FOI, it is hoped that information equals accountability. But there is a missing link here-what do you do with the information once you have it? Do you pass it to the authority itself? A member of the opposition? The press? Or do you self-publish and hope it is picked up? As this discussion on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.edemocracyblog.com/political-blog/accountability-the-problems-with-armchair-auditors/\">E-democracy</a> blog shows, it is not clear exactly where this new information fits in. Again like FOI, the data is likely to work alongside other accountability tools-the activists in Barnet have used a combination of FOI requests, the local media and judicial review.</p>\n\n<p>A final point is that Armchair Auditors, like all accountability mechanisms, work best in certain situations. A high profile controversy or scandal, as in Barnet, appears to be one way of kick starting them. A lack of activity from the official opposition or local press may drive groups to do it themselves- so auditors can fill accountability vacuums. The paradox is that for Auditors to then be effective they often need to use these other channels that failed.</p>\n\n<p>David Cameron pointed to the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal as being an example of what could happen when information was released. Yet this scandal actually illustrates how complex accountability can be. It was driven not by citizens but by determined journalists pushing a case through appeal and the courts. The key moment came via a good old fashioned (paid for) leak. It took four years, persistence and a whole range of accountability tools working in a very particular context.</p>\n\n<p>As this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1868283\">paper</a> argues, crowd sourcing exercises are often fragile and subject to bias, relying on a \u2018tiny subset\u2019. Auditors, like many other such initiatives, are better seen as a compliment to existing systems than a replacement. Auditors will rise up in certain situations and the new information will form part of the armoury of activists, journalists and NGOs. However, the citizen army is likely to remain in the barracks.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bbk.ac.uk/politics/our-staff/academic/ben-worthy\"><em>Ben Worthy</em></a>* is a lecturer in politics at Birkbeck College, University of London.

Some people want to live less than 30 minutes away from work, some want to live near a good school for their children, and others care most about living in a safe area. Without the availability of Open Data, our experimentation to develop the tools to search this information would have been a much larger challenge than it already was!\u0002\nWhy is Open Data in this context such a powerful thing? It&rsquo;s not about exposing personal information and eliminating privacy; rather it&rsquo;s about making public data available to all of us. Think public transport schedules, school league tables and crime statistics.

Quite simply, we could only have started Locatable in the UK. For example, in Germany it&rsquo;s not possible to get hold of an open data set with all of the rail and metro timetables.

In the post Fred reflects on his time at the ODI and how this benefited his work on public participation with open government data in the UK.</em></p>\n\n<p>My name is Fred Saunderson, and I spent nine weeks this summer as a research Intern at the Open Data Institute. During this time I completed my <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/cerch/study/madam/index.aspx\">Digital Asset Management (DAM) Masters degree</a> by developing my final dissertation on public participation with UK Open Government Data. While at the ODI, I was lucky enough to benefit from the institutional mission to \u201ccollaborate, incubate, nurture and mentor\u201d. My DAM degree course and the ODI are both comparatively new, so experiencing their ongoing development has been exciting. When I reflect on my time at the ODI and how it has benefited my research, an intriguing parallel emerges between the content of my work and the context of my time here. In both respects, this summer has been about shifting environments.</p>\n\n<p>Until it is marked, I want to be careful with how much of my findings I publish. However, I can certainly outline the core of my work: an effort to conceptualise \u2013 and then re-conceptualise \u2013 the UK\u2019s Open Government Data environment. I wanted to investigate public Open Data use and how the government views and constructs the environment in which this occurs. With my initial findings indicating low participation, I sought to apply the metaphorical framework of the digital ecosystem in order to re-conceptualise the current environment.</p>\n\n<p>The time I spent at the ODI has represented something of a comparable shift in environment. The mission of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/\">my university</a> (or any place of higher education) could just as equally be to \u201ccollaborate, incubate, nurture and mentor\u201d ideas. However, much as I was working to re-formulate the Open Government Data environment through my research and analysis, I experienced in my temporary move to the ODI a shift in environment, one that impacted on my work. The institute provided me with a great place from which to work, valuable connections in the field, and the opportunity to operate alongside and with like-interested people. Were I to have completed this research outwith the ODI (for example, from the university library) I no doubt would have had a fruitful and engaging time regardless. But, environmentally, the experience would have been very different.</p>\n\n<p>By way of example, one afternoon this summer, my fellow intern <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Heimstaedt\">Max</a> and I sat down to draw up a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theodi.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag6Hy6mntCy_dHAwZXFtV21acEZOdUJtZjgxWElYMVE#gid=0\">timeline</a> of the \u201cbig\u201d moments in UK Open Data policy. Sourcing our material from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opendataimpacts.net/2010/06/a-timeline-of-open-government-data/\">Open Data Impacts</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\">UK Government</a>, and inspired by our discussions with ODI team members, we compiled this timeline and then we talked our way through it together. The aim was to contextualise the history of our subject. I think it is safe to say that through the process we both made connections, insights, and discoveries that aided our work and would have otherwise gone unspotted. While that can be bracketed as \u201ccollaboration\u201d, similar benefits came during these nine weeks from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The daily morning stand-ups (when everyone says what they are doing that day, a great way for me to construct my time and hear what Open Data practitioners actually do on a Monday morning \u2013 I\u2019d call this \u201cnurturing\u201d);</li>\n  <li>The opportunity to sit in on a meeting of the Local Public Data Panel (I\u2019d call that \u201cincubating\u201d);</li>\n  <li>The input, questioning, and advice offered formally and informally by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/tom-heath\">Tom Heath</a>, my ODI supervisor, and by friendly faces from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/start-up\">start-ups</a> when we met over the coffee maker (I would certainly call that \u201cmentoring\u201d).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In all of this lies the parallel that is so interesting to me now. During my time at the ODI I experienced impact from a form of what I was attempting to elaborate in my paper: a shift in environment - not from one Open Government Data environment to another, but from the theoretical to the applied. The value of this connection emerges from the joining together of the theoretical endeavours of the research and the applied context of my internship - grasping and expanding on the similarities and connections between the two, and relating one to the other. The environmental shift in moving from the workspace of the university to the workspace of the ODI made a difference to the development, execution, and delivery of my dissertation, much as in my paper I used the digital ecosystem metaphor to shift my conceptualisation of the UK\u2019s Open Government Data environment.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to keep my research grounded in the lived reality of the UK\u2019s Open Government Data environment. Developing an academic study of Open Data is incredibly fast-paced: things are changing every day. Significantly, the content of my research was about what was happening in real-time. Academic analysis and investigation is essential, but the temporality necessitates that the discourse remains closely tied to the practice. The ODI was a strong and exciting place from which to experience the day-to-day practice of Open Data \u2013 to connect what academic investigation with the day-to-day world of Open Data application. In this respect, being able to see such a clear parallel between my experience of the summer and my approach to my research (between my working context and my work\u2019s content), is exciting and promising. The more that I can relate my academic research to my lived reality, the more pertinent and applicable the research seems.</p>\n\n<p>My experience of those nine weeks at the ODI has been fun, informative, and beneficial. In most respects, what I gained at the institute fed directly into my main output: my written dissertation. However, looking back and reflecting, there are further take-aways from the experience, such as this intriguing parallel. I know that the role of research intern is new to the ODI (being a new institution) and still in the process of development. I am excited to see where the team take this role in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The presentation of my findings to the ODI team in my final week dissolved into something more akin to a roundtable discussion, and I would be interested to see that adapted as a possible future model for wrapping up the internships. This year, the plan was for a 15 minute presentation from me and then 15 minutes of questions (that turned into roughly 35 minutes of questions and answers interspersed with the presentation - and I think it worked much better that way, the atmosphere was wonderfully conducive to analysis and consideration), but perhaps in future years the event could be billed as a (slightly longer) debate/discussion: the intern would give a very short summary of their findings and then offer some debate starters (a question, an assertion from their results, etc.), with a much longer discussion ensuing. Following from that, the production of a write up blog post (in the place of this very blog post) could be tied in: the intern would enter the discussion session planning to emerge from it and produce a short written analysis. I guess you could call this whole thing a bit of a \u201cSocratic ending\u201d to said future internship. This could even further the parallel I have outlined above, by joining the theoretical work of the intern and the applied experience of the ODI.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of future developments, from my summer at the institute, the ODI was successful in collaborating, incubating, nurturing, and mentoring. I felt this both directly through my research and less directly, through the insights derived from the environment experienced. Once my paper has been marked, I will be writing a more detailed post on my findings for this blog -\u0002look out for that here in the near future!</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Fred Saunderson","slug":"fred-saunderson","web_url":"http://theodi.org/fred-saunderson","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Fred Saunderson","slug":"fred-saunderson","web_url":"http://theodi.org/fred-saunderson","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-in-the-judiciaries-of-argentina-chile-and-uruguay.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-in-the-judiciaries-of-argentina-chile-and-uruguay","slug":"open-data-in-the-judiciaries-of-argentina-chile-and-uruguay","title":"Guest blog post: Open Data in the judiciaries of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:40+01:00","created_at":"2014-06-03T15:47:24+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/buenos-aires-node-news-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/buenos-aires-node-news-2014","slug":"buenos-aires-node-news-2014","title":"Buenos Aires  node news: January 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:59+01:00","created_at":"2014-01-24T12:48:44+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"Open data judiciary Argentina, Chile, Uruguay","excerpt":"In 2013 CIPPEC\u2019s Justice program developed the project Emerging Impacts in Open Data that focused on the judiciaries of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay*.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p>In 2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cippec.org\">CIPPEC\u2019s</a> Justice program developed the project <em>Emerging Impacts in Open Data</em> that focused on the judiciaries of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay*.</p>\n\n<p>CIPPEC&rsquo;s study focuses on the openness of judiciary data and its impact.

The Met are one of many organisations looking to reap the benefits of a development community dedicated to open software and open data, and this was a strong, promising push in that direction. It&rsquo;s a direction full of potential, and with the right focus I think events like this can bring organisations and the development community together to become powerful forces for good, helping to drive fundamental improvements in services we all depend on.</p>\n\n<p>Hackathons are a fairly new idea. They&rsquo;re simple events aiming to quickly share, create and rapidly prototype ideas, in an intense one or two day burst of imagination and innovation, fuelled with pizza and caffeine. The concept has caught on over the last decade, initially as organisations focus on driving innovation in open-source and commercial software development, later in the startup world (often for informal recruitment), and more recently in the charitable sector and public services.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://c-100.org/hack/\">Hack The Police </a>was a great example of this last category, producing a wide range of innovative prototypes including MetOS (bringing Met workflows and information together into a unified feed for officers), eRAT (a new app offering counter-terrorism advice to small businesses) and my own Secure Evidence Recorder (a tool for securely and confidentially recording evidentially-sound photos on officer&rsquo;s phones).</p>\n\n<p>The focus of more charitable hackathons like this (also including Rewired State&rsquo;s many events like <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://hacks.rewiredstate.org/events/follow-the-data-hack-day-london\">Follow the Data London </a>and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://nhshackday.com/\">NHS hack day</a>) tends to be quite different to commercial hackathons, which want new products and game-changing ideas. The Met police staff I talked to had far less enthusiasm for more toys and gadgets in our age of austerity, and instead were looking to improve their current systems, few of which take advantage of the technological advances in recent years to provide easier access to data, and simplify away painful manual processes.</p>\n\n<p>Changes like these require progressive improvements to replace existing processes with new ones, as doing a major overhaul of systems at this scale (the Met is London&rsquo;s largest employer) in one go simply can&rsquo;t work, even ignoring the expense. This however hits against another problem; replacing paper with tech necessitates infrastructure, to securely expose criminal records, provide public information on ongoing cases and store digital evidence, and those services simply don&rsquo;t yet exist.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately hackathons don&rsquo;t have this problem. Hackathons are for prototyping; illustrating the potential futures we could live in with minimal demos and colourful outlines that let you squint at worlds of possibilities. Hack teams liberally use fake data to build fully functional tools, under the collective delusion that this infrastructure exists, quickly showing exactly what&rsquo;s possible if it did.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to see this potential is a powerful thing. It immediately grabs people, engages them, and shows what could be. It also, critically, shows what it currently isn&rsquo;t, and the prototypes built attach explicit value to those missing elements.</p>\n\n<p>Highlighting this potential value is key. The fundamental blocker to modernizing the Met may be lack of good infrastructure, but the blocker to putting that in place is the uncertainty in its value. Building infrastructure alone is a project with clear cost and no clear value, which just won&rsquo;t happen.</p>\n\n<p>Add value though, and outline the infrastructure needed, and this becomes clearly worthwhile, especially since you&rsquo;re showing a minimum value, and the possibility of much more later. This is what a good hack should do, and I think this is where the real magic of hackathons lies.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the goal of hackathons in public services shouldn&rsquo;t be to come up with shiny new toys; the goal should be to come up with reasons to build open infrastructure now, lowering the barrier for future hackathons, shrinking the gap between what exists and what could be, and building momentum towards further openness and improvement in these organisations. This eventually feeds back around, with each hackathon providing better and better tools for the next, provoking better ideas and hacks in turn.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s clear hackathons alone are powerful events filled with potential for improving our world. I&rsquo;m hopeful that with this we can use them to drive a wave of open systems and data, and exponentially improve our public services for everybody. The Metropolitan Police&rsquo;s first hackathon was great, but I&rsquo;d love to use that to make the second even greater.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Tim Perry","slug":"tim-perry","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tim-perry","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Tim Perry","slug":"tim-perry","web_url":"http://theodi.org/tim-perry","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-blog-taking-pain-out-moving-house.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-taking-pain-out-moving-house","slug":"guest-blog-taking-pain-out-moving-house","title":"Guest blog: Taking the pain out of moving house","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:30+01:00","created_at":"2013-02-22T15:44:36+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"Moving house is tough.

Where can I afford to live? Where will my kids go to school? Is the area safe? A lot of the common questions people have when moving can be informed by open data sets.\u0002\nSchool performance data, crime statistics and many other sets of public service information have all been published as open data. Rather than have to move in to an area blind, citizens can now research all the important information themselves online and build up a picture of what their life would be like in their new home.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the most important open data sets that home owners are most interested in and who publishes them:</p>\n\n<p>1) Recent house prices are now available for free to the public through the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/public\">Land Registry</a>. Monthly data on individual prices that houses have transacted at are available, as well as a House Price Index (HPI) which gives average house prices at national, regional, county and London borough level.\u0002\n2) School data is released by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/\">Department of Education</a>\u0002annually. This gives basic information on all schools, such as address and what ages &amp; gender(s) they accept as well as detailed exam performance information.</p>\n\n<p>3) Crime data is proved by the Ministry for Justice &amp; the Home Office on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.police.uk/\">Police.uk</a>. Users can get information about any police force in England and the crime levels in their areas.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge now is for\u0002entrepreneurs\u0002to take this open data and interpret it to turn it into a useful format for people to benefit from. At <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.locatable.com/\">Locatable</a>, we&rsquo;re attempting to tackle this problem by developing a product that will allow users to search across all these data sets in one place.\u0002\nWe can also provide extra value by taking other data sets that aren&rsquo;t very usable and processing them in a useful format. Public transport data is a great example - the raw data by itself can be hard to glean any insights from but we allow users to frame the problem in a way that answers the questions house hunters most want to know: &ldquo;where can I live that is within half an hour&rsquo;s travel of my office?&rdquo;, for example.</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s many more different factors that affect where someone decides to live and there&rsquo;s even more data out there which can be used to answer other questions about different places across the UK - Is it a scenic area? Is it a loud or quiet place to live? Am I near good shops and other amenities that I&rsquo;m interested in? In time, we hope to answer these as well.</p>\n\n<p>Our vision of changing the way people decide where to live wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without the data that underpins us, and we&rsquo;re convinced open data unlocks the potential for innovative ideas and products that couldn&rsquo;t be developed any other way.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Vasanth Subramanian","slug":"vasanth-subramanian","web_url":"http://theodi.org/vasanth-subramanian","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Vasanth Subramanian","slug":"vasanth-subramanian","web_url":"http://theodi.org/vasanth-subramanian","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/a-step-forward-for-democratic-engagement.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/a-step-forward-for-democratic-engagement","slug":"a-step-forward-for-democratic-engagement","title":"Guest post: A step forward for democratic engagement","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:36+01:00","created_at":"2014-05-30T17:01:27+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/friday-lunchtime-lecture-democracy-and-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-democracy-and-data","slug":"friday-lunchtime-lecture-democracy-and-data","title":"Friday lunchtime lecture: Democracy and data","format":"event","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:14+01:00","created_at":"2014-01-29T15:11:05+00:00","tag_ids":["lunchtime-lecture"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"Election data can help give insights into voting behaviour, but the lack of open data is hampering the analysis researchers can do argue the Open Data Institute and Deloitte","excerpt":"Even after the local council elections in England and Northern Ireland on 22 May, which coincided with polling for the European Parliament, the next 12 months remain a busy time for the democratic process in the United Kingdom.

Finally, the first fixed-term parliament in Westminster comes to an end with a General Election in all areas of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in May 2015.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure that as many people as possible are eligible and able to vote, the Government is launching an ambitious programme of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/faq/voting-and-registration/what-is-individual-electoral-registration\">Individual Electoral Registration</a> (IER) this summer. This will mean that the traditional, paper-based approach to household registration will shift to a tailored and largely digital process more in-keeping with the data-driven demands of the twenty-first century.

In the United States, for example, the introduction of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_election_voting_controversies#Voting_machines\">new voting machines created much controversy</a> even though they are capable of providing \u2018near-perfect\u2019 ballot data. </p>\n\n<p>The UK\u2019s democratic process is not completely blind, though. Numerous opinion surveys are conducted both before and after polling, including the long-running British Election Study, to understand the shifting attitudes of a representative cross-section of the electorate. </p>\n\n<p>But if the Government does not retain in sufficient geographic detail digital information on the number of people who vote, then how can it learn what is necessary to reverse the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2013/dec/27/voter-apathy-1964-2010-change-voting-behaviour\">long-running decline in turnout?</a>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The effects of lack of data</strong></p>\n\n<p>To add to the debate around democratic engagement, a joint research team, with data scientists from Deloitte and the Open Data Institute, have been attempting to understand what makes voters tick. </p>\n\n<p>Our research has been hampered by a significant lack of relevant data describing voter behaviour at electoral ward level, as well as difficulties in matching what little data is available to other open data sources, such as demographic data from the 2011 Census. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/administrative/england/electoral-wards-divisions/index.html\">A ward is an administrative division of a city or borough that typically elects and is represented by a councillor or councillors.</a></p>\n\n<p>Even though individual ballot papers are collected and verified for counting the number of votes per candidate \u2013 the primary aim of elections, after all \u2013 the only recent elections for which aggregate turnout statistics have been published at ward level are the 2012 local council elections in England and Wales. In these elections, approximately 3,000 wards from a total of over 8,000 voted. Data published by the Electoral Commission for the 2013 local council elections in England and Wales purports to be at ward level but is, in fact, for \u2018county electoral divisions\u2019, as explained <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/administrative/england/electoral-wards-divisions/index.html.\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>Moreover, important factors related to the accessibility of polling stations \u2013 such as the distance from main population centres \u2013 could not be assessed because the location of polling stations remains the responsibility of individual local authorities \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/data/search?q=polling+station\">and only eight of these have so far published their data as open data.</a></p>\n\n<p>Given these fundamental limitations, drawing any robust conclusions is difficult. Nevertheless, our research shows the potential for forecasting electoral turnout with relatively few census variables, the most significant of which are age and the size of the electorate in each ward.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/8c/14/538c14f0d0d46207ff00000f/Median_Age_1000x1000.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"attachment-538c14f0f362be0d420000af\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Median age by ward</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/8c/14/538c148dd0d46207ff00000b/Turnout_1000x1000.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"attachment-538c148d1f986a085b00007b\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Turnout percentage by ward</em></p>\n\n<p><em>[NB: Only showing those wards that voted in the 2012 local council elections]</em></p>\n\n<p>Wards with a high proportion of older people in the electorate tended to experience higher turnout in the 2012 elections. Younger electorates, on the other hand, experienced lower turnout. The challenge for policy makers here is that although young people remain interested in politics, they are disengaged and disillusioned with the electoral process \u2013 preferring instead to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/research/microsites/epop/papers/Henn_and_Foard_-_Young_People,_Political_Participation_and_Trust_in_Britain.pdf\">express their individual opinions via social media</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, the highest turnouts in the local council elections of 2012 were achieved in wards with a small electorate. One of the reasons for this may be that a community \u2018network effect\u2019 is more effective in rural wards. From a statistical perspective, there is a greater likelihood that small wards may experience results that deviate significantly from average turnout, which has very little to do with causal factors. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What role can open data play?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The limited results described above provide a tantalising glimpse into a possible future scenario: where open data provides a deeper and more granular understanding of electoral behaviour. On the back of more sophisticated analyses, policies for improving democratic engagement \u2013 particularly among young people \u2013 have the potential to become focused and evidence-driven. And, although the data captured on election day will always remain primarily for the use of electing the public\u2019s preferred candidate, an important secondary consideration is aggregating and publishing data that can be used more widely. This may have been prohibitively expensive or too complex in the past but as storage and processing costs continue to fall, and the appetite for such knowledge grows, there is a compelling business case. </p>\n\n<p>The benefits of this future scenario potentially include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>tailoring awareness and marketing campaigns to wards and other segments of the electorate most likely to respond positively and subsequently turn out to vote</li>\n  <li>increasing the efficiency with which European, general and local elections are held in the UK</li>\n  <li>improving transparency around the electoral process and stimulating increased democratic engagement</li>\n  <li>enhancing links to the Government\u2019s other significant data collection activities, including the Census.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Achieving these benefits requires commitment to electoral data being collected and published in a systematic fashion at least at ward level. This would link work currently undertaken by the Electoral Commission, the Office for National Statistics, Plymouth University\u2019s Election Centre, the British Election Study and the more than 400 Local Authorities across the UK.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Harvey Lewis, Deloitte.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Ulrich Atz, Gianfranco Cecconi, Tom Heath, the Open Data Institute.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In this article, references to Deloitte are references to Deloitte LLP, the UK member firm of DTTL.</em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"Guest post: A step forward for democratic engagement","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Harvey Lewis","slug":"harvey-lewis","web_url":"http://theodi.org/harvey-lewis","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Harvey Lewis","slug":"harvey-lewis","web_url":"http://theodi.org/harvey-lewis","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/guest-post-creating-value-from-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-post-creating-value-from-open-data","slug":"guest-post-creating-value-from-open-data","title":"Guest post: Creating value for universities from open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:55+01:00","created_at":"2014-06-24T20:46:18+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"Open data, the principle and practice of making data available for anyone to use, for any purpose, at no cost has the potential to make a major impact on the world around us.

Given these prospects, the UK higher education sector is already starting to get on board. A number of universities (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.southampton.ac.uk\">Southampton</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk\">Oxford</a>, and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk\">Open University</a>, to name a few) have taken on the agenda, and are rapidly developing tools and practices. Sector agencies and bodies such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jisc.ac.uk\">JISC</a> (Joint Information Systems Committee), <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk\">HESA</a> (Higher Education Statistics Agency), the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rcuk.ac.uk\">Research Councils</a>, and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://royalsociety.org\">Royal Society</a> are also working in the same direction.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx\">Universities UK</a> is also leading work on open data. We are particularly pleased to announce the launch today of a joint programme with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org\">Open Data Institute</a>. A number of universities and partner organisations have already signed up to the programme, which will increase capacity, develop and share good practice as well as devise new tools and services for universities. We anticipate that others will join over the course of the next few months, as the programme is rolled out more widely.</p>\n\n<p>This is our challenge (and our opportunity) to demonstrate the rewards of open data. There are a number of advantages in open data and three of these positive prospects are outlined below.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, increased efficiency. Universities UK has been leading a programme of work which supports efficiency and modernisation in the university sector. Open data can play a key role in this. Releasing data on, for example, procurement costs, energy costs and usage, or space utilisation will allow institutions to benchmark one another and drive down costs. There may also be opportunities through transferring good practice from one part of the sector to another.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, improved student services. Opening up institutional data on admission, provision and progression can improve student choice, as potential students are able to draw on a wider range of data to make more informed choices. From the institutional point of view, opening up their own data and combining them with open data from external sources can help improve the targeting of marketing and recruitment activities.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, access to research. There is a strong push to make research data more open and widely-available. Open data not only helps the research process by allowing researchers to build more rapidly on the work of others, but can potentially contribute to economic growth through widening opportunities for exploitation. Some academic domains are already leading this field, such as the galaxy zoo project that is publishing data from space telescopes to enable volunteers to help classify the millions of galaxies that have been pictured. Fields such as genomics are also going down the open data route though initiatives such as the personal genomic project.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst there are plenty of opportunities arising from open data, there are also challenges and risks. Capacity and infrastructure need to be developed which will require investment. Institutions will need to overcome concerns about competition and information exchange. There are also other considerations, including the need to protect the sector\u2019s information assets from cyber-attack, allied to issues of privacy and data protection.</p>\n\n<p>As part of this work we are running a series of seminars on open data which will continue into the autumn, culminating in a conference. There will also be further UUK outputs on this topic along the way, so watch this space.</p>\n\n<p>The potential benefits of open data are already starting to show. And with the help of all organisations and universities involved, together with a facilitating environment encouraged by government policy and technology adoption, open data will accelerate developments substantially.</p>\n\n<p><em>Paul Clark is director of policy at Universities UK.

Where can we find it? Why should we think about designing services with it? What methods and processes can we use? Artists <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kasiamolga.net/\">Kasia Molga</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://fabiolattanziantinori.com/\">Fabio Lattanzi Antinori</a> then presented their own data driven artworks, providing further insights into creative uses of data.</p>\n\n<p>A working lunch was next: our task was to identify problems or opportunities relating to the environment, education, business and commerce, finance, transport, or health and well-being. We then formed 5 teams around the identified issues, and were asked to design a service or product that would use open data to address them. The afternoon was spent furiously working to identify and describe our users, their needs, the data we might use and our proposed solutions. This is what the teams came up with:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Serendipity</strong> - a service that enables people to trade their skills and experience instead of relying on money, using data created through endorsements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Skool of Different Thoughts</strong> - a vision for the future of education, where teaching models are designed around the different learning styles and values of children.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bank of Trust</strong> - A design for a future where knowledge is prescribed by the NHS and trust becomes the new currency.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Flockr</strong> - a mobile app designed to help partially sighted people navigate the city, using open street maps, gps and user generated data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Echo n</strong> - a service that removes space debris by enablng customers to bid for it through online trading.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the teams pitched their ideas to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks\">Gavin Starks</a>, the ODI&rsquo;s CEO, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/team/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich Atz</a>, Head of Statistics, and curator <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ShiriShalmy\">Shiri Shalmy</a>, and after some deliberation, the prize went to the Flockr team.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/87/3c/53873cf61f986a085f000028/Untitled-1.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"attachment-53873cf6d0d4620810000003\" /></p>\n\n<p>It was an energetic, thought provoking day, with a high level of intellectual rigour demonstrated by UAL\u2019s students.

However, it is possible today to address them very effectively by leveraging predictive analytics: mathematical models able to robustly infer the behaviour of the citizens, and make accurate predictions about their future behaviours.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a concrete example: my company, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://snips.net\" title=\"We Scale Cities: Snips\">Snips</a>, launched in June an application \u2014 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://tranquilien.com\" title=\"Tranquilien\">Tranquilien</a> \u2014 in partnership with the french rail operator SNCF to predict the number of people in commuting trains. The application allows anyone to enter a departure and destination, and a date in the future, to know whether they will be able to ride in a free seat. This in turn enables companies and individuals to make smarter scheduling decisions, and shift the employee arrival or departure time by 15 or 30 minutes for a better ride. The global impact will be a reduction in peak hours and a better efficiency of the train network usage.</p>\n\n<p>Constructing such mathematical models require using massive amounts of data. Indeed, it is not sufficient to know the past historical usage data for each train, but the tools we develop at Snips reconstruct the whole event context: what time it was, was it a period of vacation, was it raining, was there a concert near the station, etc. This enables us to infer patterns and make better predictions. In order to build such detailed contexts, we rely heavily on quality open-data initiatives all over the world.</p>\n\n<p>The potential of this approach is enormous, and its applications very versatile: we have made a very precise model of the crowd at postal offices in Paris, we predict the availability of parking spots in New-York, and are now developing a predictive model of traffic accidents by modelling the areas of danger in cities and the behaviour of drivers.</p>\n\n<p>By leveraging the contextual modelling of cities and the open-data sets we are now able to construct tools that improve the life of citizens and make the usage of urban infrastructure more efficient at a very low cost.</p>\n\n<p><em>Dr Ma\u00ebl Primet, is a mathematician, entrepreneur and co-founder of Snips.</em></p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"How employing open data can allow us to make better decisions when it comes to planning how we use and develop our transport networks.","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Ma\u00ebl Primet","slug":"mal-primet","web_url":"http://theodi.org/mal-primet","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Ma\u00ebl Primet","slug":"mal-primet","web_url":"http://theodi.org/mal-primet","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/how-to-get-developers-to-use-your-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/how-to-get-developers-to-use-your-open-data","slug":"how-to-get-developers-to-use-your-open-data","title":"Guest post: How to get developers to use your open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:56+01:00","created_at":"2013-11-27T14:59:35+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"\u201cIf you build it, they will come!\u201d.

Eloquent I know.</p>\n\n<p>The week-long course gave an overview of open data generally \u2013 practical, legal, business, technical, cultural, visual \u2013 and was usefully hands-on throughout. My course mates were from industry, business, academia and the public sector; from Scotland; Russia and the UAE. The food was also delicious.</p>\n\n<p>We were asked to bring a dataset to play with for the week, so I chose the first iteration of the list of what the UK has identified as the 300 or so most important datasets: the<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/library/national-information-infrastructure-narrative\"> National Information Infrastructure</a> (made up of a<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/dataset/national-information-infrastructure\"> summary CSV file</a> as well as<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/data/search?core_dataset=true\"> tagged records</a> within the data.gov.uk portal). I wanted to see what I could do with it to help make it a more useful dataset&hellip;at the same time as learning about what tools are available, and how easy or not they are to use.</p>\n\n<h3>Learning through doing</h3>\n\n<p>The main thing I did was explore the<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\"> Open Data Certificate</a> that the<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/news/new-certificates-launched-help-everyone-discover-understand-and-use-open-data\"> ODI launched the beta version of around the G8 Summit</a> earlier this year. I walked through it with the original NII summary file (CSV), partly to understand the process, and partly to understand how we measured up! UK government has set itself a stretch target to put all of its most important datasets through the certificate.</p>\n\n<h3>Showing your working</h3>\n\n<p>I stepped through each question (after quickly registering), in a relatively easy to use interface which gives you the option of both finding out more information about each question, as well as asking specific questions when you get stuck (although this understandably does not happen straight away, and so might put your completion of the certificate on hold).</p>\n\n<h3>Testing times</h3>\n\n<p>On pressing \u2018submit\u2019 the assessment came back as a \u2018Raw\u2019 certificate, meaning we were still at the most basic of four levels. I then clicked on \u2018How Can I Improve My Data?\u2019 link, and discovered a helpful list of pointers to moving it through the next levels. There was only one additional task to complete to move it up to the second level \u2018Pilot\u2019. I looked again at the question and was able to address that specific issue, making a small change, and moving the dataset up to the status of<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/datasets/932/certificates/13133\"> \u2018Pilot\u2019!</a> Still two stages to go, but, armed with the list of suggested improvements I was able to return to Cabinet Office to feedback my findings to people in the team.</p>\n\n<p>There was also the opportunity to provide feedback to ODI colleagues on the certificate, and I did so on one aspect relating to the fact that data.gov.uk sometimes points to resources, and sometimes houses them. I suggested that the certificate might want to give the option of explaining further context to datasets referenced through such a portal.</p>\n\n<h3>School\u2019s out</h3>\n\n<p>I bounded back to Cabinet Office, full of energy and excitement, feeling confident and empowered to convey the benefits of how much your understanding can be furthered by taking a single, familiar dataset through the certificate. I was quickly brought back down to earth by the head of data.gov.uk who highlighted: &ldquo;there are many datasets which need much more basic quality considerations being made, for example correcting basic errors within the data, and adding simple metadata, way before we get close to assessment using the open data certificate&rdquo;. He has explained much of this is a useful<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/blog/simple-intro-open-data\"> blog post</a>, and indeed the Open Data in Practice course covers much of this too.</p>\n\n<h3>Term starts</h3>\n\n<p>But that\u2019s ok, because the certificate is partly a measurement tool, partly an educational process, and helps anyone who publishes data understand the importance of contextual information from the point of view of a consumer, interested in using that data.</p>\n\n<p>For successfully completing the course we also received a certificate, which now sits alongside by screen at work, reminding me of everything I learnt.

The prevailing public mood was summed up by the Queen during a visit to the London School of Economics in 2008 when she pointed to the elephant in the room by asking \u201cWhy did no one see it coming?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In their defence, some of the more thoughtful financial economists have argued along the lines set out by John Kay that &ldquo;economies are complex, dynamic, non-linear systems in which small differences to initial conditions can make large differences to final outcomes \u2013 the proverbial flapping of a butterfly\u2019s wings that causes a hurricane.\u201d[1] </p>\n\n<p>However, this line of reasoning doesn&rsquo;t quite let the economics profession off the hook. Research into these types of systems is mainstream within modern science, constantly providing us with both a better understanding of their behaviour, and the opportunity to control them through new technologies. So why doesn&rsquo;t financial economics exhibit the same type of scientific and technological progress? Why, for example, is the recurring boom-bust cycle still treated as an ineffable Act of God, rather than as a property of a financial system that can be understood and controlled?</p>\n\n<p>In addressing this question, it&rsquo;s instructive to look at how scientists and financial economists go about their respective work. Take the Large Hadron Collider and the associated recent discovery of the Higgs Boson, for example. Here is the big daddy of all &lsquo;complex, dynamic, non-linear systems&rsquo; \u2013 attempting to recreate the initial conditions at the birth of the universe. Within the LHC, 150 million sensors monitor the granular events that make up the system&rsquo;s behaviour, (including 600 million particle collisions per second). This is truly raw data as Big Data. </p>\n\n<p>Financial economists are spared the need to simulate their system-in-focus, as it&rsquo;s taking place all around them. Rather, their problem lies in the lack of raw data with which to work. These generally remain locked up within the economic agents which generate them, typically within the financial ledgers of individual firms and institutions. In the absence of this granular data, financial economists, (as well as policy-makers, regulators, investors, tax payers, et al), are obliged to fall back on published accounts and other statutory reporting, which generally only deal in aggregated data, (and which have typically been parsed by a financial intermediary, such as an auditor). </p>\n\n<p>This is comparable to the scientists at CERN seeking to understand what happened during the Big Bang by studying an artist&rsquo;s impression of the moment of creation. The recent award of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics to a trio of economists with mutually-exclusive theories of how the financial system works drives home the point. To quote John Kay again, this was akin to \u201cawarding the physics prize jointly to Ptolemy for his theory that the Earth is at the centre of the universe, and to Copernicus for showing it is not.\u201d[2]</p>\n\n<p>Economists often stand accused of physics envy. However, if they really want to become more like physicists then they should be campaigning for our financial system to be turned inside-out, and for its raw data to become a matter of public record: transforming it from closed data into open data. Capitalism&rsquo;s financial plumbing is too important to remain walled-up: like the architecture of the iconic Lloyds Building in the City of London, it needs to be on the outside, where we can all see it. </p>\n\n<p>[1] John Kay, FT, 25.11.08</p>\n\n<p>[2] John Kay, FT, 15.10.13</p>\n\n<p><em>Greg Elliott is founder of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.systemsincontext.co.uk\">Systems in Context Ltd</a>, a provider of Enterprise Architecture and Design services.</em>\n<em>The company&rsquo;s latest initiative - Business Engineering for Start-ups \u2013 will be launched in early 2014, based upon Open Business Design principles.

Governments, the private sector, individuals and communities all stand to benefit from the innovation and information that will inform investment, drive the creation of new industries, and inform decision making and research. To mark a step change in the way valuable information is created and reused, the G20 should release information as open data.</p>\n\n<p>In May 2014, Omidyar Network commissioned Lateral Economics to undertake economic analysis on the potential of open data to support the G20\u2019s 2% growth target and illustrate how an open data agenda can make a significant contribution to economic growth and productivity. Combining all G20 economies, output could increase by USD 13 trillion cumulatively over the next five years. Implementation of open data policies would thus boost cumulative G20 GDP by around 1.1 percentage points (almost 55%) of the G20\u2019s 2% growth target over five years.</p>\n\n<h3>Recommendations</h3>\n\n<p>Importantly, open data cuts across a number of this year\u2019s G20 priorities: attracting private infrastructure investment, creating jobs and lifting participation, strengthening tax systems and fighting corruption. This memo suggests an open data thread that runs across all G20 priorities. The more data is opened, the more it can be used, reused, repurposed and built on\u2014in combination with other data\u2014for everyone\u2019s benefit.</p>\n\n<p>We call on G20 economies to sign up to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter/g8-open-data-charter-and-technical-annex\">Open Data Charter</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The G20 should ensure that data released by G20 working groups and themes is in line with agreed open data standards. This will lead to more accountable, efficient, effective governments who are going further to expose inadequacy, fight corruption and spur innovation.</p>\n\n<p>Data is a national resource and open data is a \u2018win-win\u2019 policy. It is about making more of existing resources. We know that the cost of opening data is smaller than the economic returns, which could be significant. Methods to respect privacy concerns must be taken into account. If this is done, as the public and private sector share of information grows, there will be increasing positive returns.</p>\n\n<h3>The G20 opportunity</h3>\n\n<p>This November, leaders of the G20 Member States will meet in Australia to drive forward commitments made in the St Petersburg G20 Leaders Declaration last September and to make firm progress on stimulating growth. Actions across the G20 will include increasing investment, lifting employment and participation, enhancing trade and promoting competition.</p>\n\n<p>The resulting \u2018Brisbane Action Plan\u2019 will encapsulate all of these commitments with the aim of raising the level of G20 output by at least 2% above the currently projected level over the next five years. There are major opportunities for cooperative and collective action by G20 governments.</p>\n\n<p>Governments should intensify the release of existing public sector data \u2013 both government and publicly funded research data. But much more can be done to promote open data than simply releasing more government data.In appropriate circumstances, governments can mandate public disclosure of private sector data (e.g. in corporate financial reporting).</p>\n\n<h3>Recommendations for action</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>G20 governments should adopt the principles of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter/g8-open-data-charter-and-technical-annex\">Open Data Charter</a> to encourage the building of stronger, more interconnected societies that better meet the needs of our citizens and allow innovation and prosperity to flourish.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>G20 governments should adopt specific open data targets under each G20 theme, as illustrated below, such as releasing open data related to beneficial owners of companies, as well revenues from extractive industries</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>G20 governments should consider harmonizing licensing regimes across the G20</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>G20 governments should adopt metrics for measuring the quantity and quality of open data publication, e.g. using the Open Data Institute\u2019s<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\"> Open Data Certificates</a> as a bottom-up mechanism for driving the adoption of common standards.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Illustrative G20 examples</h3>\n\n<p><em>Fiscal and monetary policy</em></p>\n\n<p>Governments possess rich real time data that is not open or accessed by government macro-economic managers. G20 governments should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open up models that lie behind economic forecasts and help assess alternative policy settings;</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Publish spending and contractual data to enable comparative shopping by government between government suppliers.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Anti corruption</em></p>\n\n<p>Open data may directly contribute to reduced corruption by increasing the likelihood corruption will be detected. G20 governments should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Release open data related to beneficial owners of companies as well as revenues from extractive industries,</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Collaborate on harmonised technical standards that permit the tracing of international money flows \u2013 including the tracing of beneficial owners of commercial entities, and the comparison and reconciliation of transactions across borders.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Trade</em></p>\n\n<p>Obtaining and using trade data from multiple jurisdictions is difficult. Access fees, specific licenses, and non-machine readable formats all involve large transaction costs. G20 governments should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Harmonise open data policies related to trade data.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Use standard trade schema and formats.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Employment</em></p>\n\n<p>Higher quality information on employment conditions would facilitate better matching of employees to organizations, producing greater job-satisfaction and improved productivity. G20 governments should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open up centralised job vacancy registers to provide new mechanisms for people to find jobs.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Provide open statistical information about the demand for skills in particular areas to help those supporting training and education to hone their offerings.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Energy</em></p>\n\n<p>Open data will help reduce the cost of energy supply and improve energy efficiency. G20 governments should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Provide incentives for energy companies to publish open data from consumers and suppliers to enable cost savings through optimizing energy plans.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Release energy performance certifications for buildings</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Publish real-time energy consumption for government buildings.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Infrastructure</em></p>\n\n<p>Current infrastructure asset information is fragmented and inefficient. Exposing current asset data would be a significant first step in understanding gaps and providing new insights.

It is seen as the most significant federal transparency reform since President Johnson signed the US Freedom of Information Act in 1967.</p>\n\n<p>The DATA Act will introduce significant benefits, not just in terms of transparency (addressing the &ldquo;Open Data Agenda&rdquo;), but also in standardising currently unaligned systems of accounting across national and local government and other public sector organisations.  It\u2019s also expected to drive increased efficiencies in budget management.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The opportunity for the UK</strong></p>\n\n<p>The US administration has given a strong lead in an area to which the UK is already committed: its stance aligns with the ambitions outlined in our Prime Minister\u2019s 31 October <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-at-open-government-partnership-2013\">speech</a> at the 2013 Open Government Partnership Summit in London.</p>\n\n<p>The Open Government Partnership identifies significant benefits stemming from opening up government data to increased scrutiny, in areas such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>fighting corruption</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>strengthening democracy</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>empowering citizens</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>enabling civil society and government to work together for a better future</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, effective standardisation and the opening up of public sector budget and spend tracking and its reporting would deliver time and cost savings.</p>\n\n<p>If replicated in the UK, a DATA Act would be a major contribution to enabling scrutiny of public expenditure and would align well with the EU Accounting and Transparency Directives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>An Open Data Coalition for the UK</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Data Transparency Coalition is an American trade association advocating US government data reform. It brings together technology companies, non-profit organisations and individuals to support policies that require federal agencies to publish their data online, using standardised, machine-readable, non-proprietary data standards. Members include sector leaders such as Teradata Corporation, WebFilings, RR Donnelley, and PwC, and smaller start-ups such as Level One Technologies and BrightScope.</p>\n\n<p>The need for us to work together in a co-ordinated way makes a strong case for the establishment of an Open Data Coalition for the UK, bringing together all interested parties who are united in wanting to achieve the goal of a UK DATA Act.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our existing national commitment to open data points towards championing a UK DATA Act amongst our community:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>our colleagues</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>our partners</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>our clients</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Government and NGOs</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We need to establish a UK coalition of those seeking to promote a DATA Act for the UK and need to consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>how we work together to accelerate the introduction of a DATA Act here</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>who we should be talking to within our own organisations</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>who we should be talking with beyond our own organisations</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>who should be the focal point for those promoting open data and the value of a UK DATA Act</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>whether the US Data Transparency Coalition provides a basic template for our work in the UK</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hughbrookes\">Hugh Brookes</a> is manager, government sector at CoreFiling.</em></p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"Guest blog posts: Hugh Brookes","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Hugh Brookes","slug":"hugh-brooks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/hugh-brooks","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Hugh Brookes","slug":"hugh-brooks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/hugh-brooks","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/typhoon-haiyan-and-the-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/typhoon-haiyan-and-the-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team","slug":"typhoon-haiyan-and-the-humanitarian-openstreetmap-team","title":"Guest post: Typhoon Haiyan - Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team respond","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:59+01:00","created_at":"2013-11-25T14:23:03+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"On the 14 November, the ODI hosted a Mapathon event by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team to help improve map coverage in the Philippines.

The project invites anyone and everyone to join in with editing the map, with iterative improvements being made in a wiki-like process. This platform is resulting in a large, complex, and hugely valuable open data set. A good cause in itself.</p>\n\n<p>But it turns out it is also a platform for humanitarian work and disaster response. OpenStreetMap combines simple map editing tools, with a rapid re-rendering feedback loop. This allows the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team to teach mapping skills to local people in the developing world, and to respond rapidly and effectively with maps and with open data in disaster zones. </p>\n\n<p>This principle was demonstrated after the Haiti earthquake of 2010, when hundreds of OpenStreetMap contributors leapt into action to create a good detailed street map. By far the best map available, and crucially this map was in place in time for search and rescue teams to discover it and use it.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re doing it again for the Philippines, but this time around there are some exciting differences which were evident at our Mapathon event last week. Firstly, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team has developed tools and processes centred around a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://tasks.hotosm.org/\" title=\"tasking manager\">tasking manager</a> which improve the way we coordinate mapping work. We completed quite a few task squares that evening, as well as discussing and learning how best to make use of the tool.</p>\n\n<p>A second difference is that aid agencies, who previously were only discovering OpenStreetMap for the first time, are now more clued in, and are really interested in engaging with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team - as evidenced by their attendance at the event. Ivan Gayton of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.msf.org.uk/\" title=\"MSF UK\">MSF UK</a> gave a presentation about how they were able to use OpenStreetMap data to correlate outbreaks of cholera in Haiti.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/harrywood/10863043326/\" title=\"OpenStreetMap HOT typhoon mapping mapathon by Harry Wood, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3709/10863043326_fbfa60873b.jpg\" width=\"695\" height=\"500\" alt=\"OpenStreetMap HOT typhoon mapping mapathon\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Andrew Braye from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/\" title=\"British Red Cross\">British Red Cross</a> told us that in the London office they are contributing to OpenStreetMap directly. This is the most powerful way to openly share the geographic data they need, with American Red Cross teams who are heading out there.</p>\n\n<p>This event was educational and inspiring, but it was organised at very short notice in order to respond in a timely manner. I&rsquo;m sorry some people missed out because they didn&rsquo;t hear about it in time. But the mapping work goes on. </p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to join in with mapping in the Philippines you&rsquo;ll find more information and links <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://hot.openstreetmap.org/projects/typhoon_haiyan_0\" title=\"on the H.O.T. website\">on the H.O.T. website</a>. If you spend the time to equip yourself with OpenStreetMap editing skills, this will allow you to join in with future crisis response mapping. Having more volunteers with this capacity is our principle need. You can also donate to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team to support our work.</p>\n\n<p>There are more face-to-face events happening in London.

I have spoken to the executive boards of publishers who have done just fine for centuries without the esotery of description logics and persistent URIs. It can be a very tough conversation.</p>\n\n<p>The news and publishing industry want better, faster and more accurate methods of gathering information (cheaper would be nice too). This way, their journalists and editors can produce the <strong>important and useful</strong> content and information their organisations have staked their reputations upon. The provision of &lsquo;important and useful information&rsquo; is an ideal stated in the prime directives of Linked Open Data espoused by Tim Berners-Lee.\nIn the last few years, the conversations have been getting easier and more often than not, the invitation comes from someone within in the organisation who &lsquo;gets it&rsquo;. I believe this is because companies like ODI member <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ontotext.com\">Ontotext</a> have a proven track record of providing enterprises the means to boot strap client organisations&rsquo; knowledge with the Linked Open Data cloud. Organisations are beginning to appreciate that openness does not mean a lack of control.</p>\n\n<p>A recently launched example is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://newz.nl/?lang=en\">Newz</a>. It is a shared content platform bringing together news produced by the leading newspaper publishers in the Netherlands. Content is semantically tagged and linked to the Linked Open Data Cloud (e.g. dbPedia, Freebase, Geonames, MusicBrainz, Europeana, Cornetto etc).</p>\n\n<p>Ontotext&rsquo;s OWLiM forms the backbone of Newz&rsquo;s semantic media platform. The project had to convince a dozen competitors that they should open their content, their assets, to a centralized platform. The Dutch have an expression for such as task, &lsquo;wheelbarrow full of frogs&rsquo; (something akin to &lsquo;herding cats&rsquo;) but they succeeded. Additionally, Newz had to convince the newspaper publishers of the value of using data from outside the walled garden (i.e. from the LOD data sources mentioned above). This data had to be shown to be of value, correct and reliable. Here too the project succeeded. The initial stage of the project has gone live and feedback from the publishers has been positive. It is a significant achievement in many respects and bodes well for the sustainability of Linked Open Data.</p>\n\n<p>However, the platform does not publish data or content to the Linked Open Data graph, although this is something they are interested in exploring in the future.</p>\n\n<p>There are still battles to be fought, but it is important to see that technologists, open data advocates, governments and private companies are allies.</p>\n\n<p>In the spirit of that multipartite discussion, the ODI and organisations such as the BBC, EuroMoney and Affectv are participating in an event to discuss the use and potential of Linked Data. They will describe how they are currently using semantics within their organisations and discuss what further work is needed to bring this emerging technology to the mainstream.

We commit to increasing our efforts to systematically collect and publish data on government spending and performance for essential public services and activities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The UK was one of 8 founding partners. Last week saw the first anniversary of the OGP with an additional 47 countries signing up. The UK is now co-chair having with Indonesia taken over from Brazil and the US. Countries committed range far and wide \u2013 from Albania to Uruguay, the Philippines to Guatemala.</p>\n\n<p>Francis Maude representing the UK as Co-Chair said</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cOpen data is the raw material of the 21st century, a resource for a new generation of entrepreneurs. Transparency drives prosperity and growth. It shines a light on underperformance and inefficiencies in public services and allows citizens and the media to hold governments to account.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the ODI we are all about realising the potential of the Open Data that Governments and other organisations release. We are all about training and encouraging a new generation of Open Data entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n<p>What about the various OGP member nations? It is one thing to launch on Open Data national portal it is another to have it drive accountability, empower citizens, improve public services and generate social and economic value. So what will it take to turn their OGP commitments into action? I offer the following suggestions:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Open Data Commitments from the Top</h3>\n\n<p>For nation states to make progress needs top-level political support and cover. In the UK we have had Prime Ministers, Secretaries of State and Ministers all make public and quantifiable commitments. These have included commitments to publish particular data sets against deadlines, the adoption of public data principles as public policy. It is important that these commitments are made across Government Departments and not just in isolated enclaves.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Make Open Data Non-Partisan</h3>\n\n<p>One of the impressive features of the UK Open Government Data programme is that it survived contact with an election \u2013 data.gov.uk was begun under one administration and then continued and developed under another. The battle has not been between Conservative, Labour or Liberal. Open Data represents a more fundamental contest of ideas between regimes, governments and businesses that seek to be either Open or Closed.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Publish Open Data that Matters</h3>\n\n<p>It is easy to launch a national portal \u2013 data.gov.erewhon \u2013 and not too difficult to populate it with mundane national statistics or census data \u2013 some of it no doubt worthy and even useful. But the data that matters will be different. It will be the detailed spending data that shows how Governments are spending our taxes. It will be the associated contracts data that shows who that spending is with. Or the health service data that shows infection rates in hospitals or survival rates for particular procedures. It will be nationwide and detailed sets of crime data. It could be the timetable and fare data for a country\u2019s transportation system. It will be the detailed geography, postcodes or address files of a nation. And whilst this is not exhaustive you get the idea.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Use Open Licences for Open Data</h3>\n\n<p>It is a basic precondition for Open Data that the licences that accompany it are Open Licences. Licences should not contain restrictions that limit reuse. Restrictions we have seen include a limit on use of the data for commercial purposes or bringing the state in to disrepute. Open Data is built on Open Licences for which templates exist some developed by OGP countries such as the UK Open Government Licence and others by foundations committed to Open Data principles.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Establish a Demand Side</h3>\n\n<p>One of the most effective methods to secure the publication of high quality Open Government Data is to develop a demand for that data. This requires an ecosystem in which the private and public sector come to depend and value the Open Data produced. Imagine the furore that would follow if the data from GPS satellites were suddenly unavailable, or weather forecast data withdrawn. If Transport for London turned off its data feeds a lot of people would be up in arms, if UK spending data was no longer available companies and organisations that use it as an essential part of their business intelligence would be up in arms. Demand is the best stimulant for supply.</p>\n\n<p>So whilst Open Data is not everything in Open Government policy it is an essential foundation \u2013 and it should be for any Open Government Partnership.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Sir Nigel Shadbolt","slug":"nigel-shadbolt","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/nigel-shadbolt","tag_ids":["team","board"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Sir Nigel Shadbolt","slug":"nigel-shadbolt","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/nigel-shadbolt","tag_ids":["team","board"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/housing-an-open-data-challenge-and-an-opportunity.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/housing-an-open-data-challenge-and-an-opportunity","slug":"housing-an-open-data-challenge-and-an-opportunity","title":"Housing: An Open Data Challenge and An Opportunity","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:13+01:00","created_at":"2014-05-02T14:55:39+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries","slug":"opendatachallengeseries","title":"Open Data Challenge Series","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:38+01:00","created_at":"2012-12-13T09:45:46+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/energy-and-environment-programme.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/energy-and-environment-programme","slug":"energy-and-environment-programme","title":"Energy and the Environment Programme","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:37+01:00","created_at":"2013-03-27T17:50:07+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/crime-and-justice-series.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/crime-and-justice-series","slug":"crime-and-justice-series","title":"Crime and Justice: Open Data Challenge Series","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:46+01:00","created_at":"2013-03-27T15:49:15+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"Are you an expert in the housing industry?

You can find a quick interactive tutorial on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r\">Code School</a> or well-designed courses on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.datacamp.com\">DataCamp</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t installed R, you can paste and try the code at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.r-fiddle.org\">R-fiddle</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Comma separated values (CSV)</h3>\n\n<p>Reading a CSV-file from an URL could not be simpler. Here are the number of police officers in Scotland over time. </p>\n\n<pre><code>read.csv(\"http://www.quandl.com/api/v1/datasets/EUROSTAT/CRIM_PLCE_42.csv\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And yet it is not guaranteed that this works. Why? Many CSVs don&rsquo;t follow a minimal standard. For example, the first row of a CSV file should be a header row, but some data has a header row in a later line. We use the <code>skip</code> option. </p>\n\n<pre><code>read.csv(\"http://www.royalwolverhamptonhospitals.nhs.uk/files/mth%206%20september%202013%20(3).csv\", skip = 2)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, <code>read.csv()</code> does not cope well with SSL, that is https connections. An alternative employs <code>download.file</code>, see below. </p>\n\n<pre><code># Fail\nread.csv(\"https://raw.github.com/sciruela/Happiness-Salaries/master/data.csv\")\n\n# Win\nread.url &lt;- function(url, ...){\n  tmpFile &lt;- tempfile()\n  download.file(url, destfile = tmpFile, method = \"curl\")\n  url.data &lt;- read.csv(tmpFile, ...)\n  return(url.data)\n}\nread.url(\"https://raw.github.com/sciruela/Happiness-Salaries/master/data.csv\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4>What gifts did David Cameron receive in May-June 2013?</h4>\n\n<p>The UK government publishes data about gifts David Cameron receives and what happens with them. We will use it as another example.</p>\n\n<p>The data is behind a secure connection, so we use our <code>read.url</code> function. Yet it still produces an error. The reason is a \u00a3 symbol in the header row. </p>\n\n<pre><code>read.url(\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/246663/pmgiftsreceivedaprjun13.csv\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A faster and more flexible tool is <code>fread</code> from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/\">data.table</a> package (see the documentation).</p>\n\n<pre><code>install.packages(\"data.table\")\nlibrary(data.table)\n\nread.url &lt;- function(url, ...){\n  tmpFile &lt;- tempfile()\n  download.file(url, destfile = tmpFile, method = \"curl\")\n  url.data &lt;- fread(tmpFile, ...)\n  return(url.data)\n}\n\nread.url(\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/246663/pmgiftsreceivedaprjun13.csv\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the results are:</p>\n\n<table class=\"table offers table-horizontally-condensed\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Date received</th>\n    <th>From</th>\n    <th>Gift</th>\n    <th>Value</th>\n    <th>Outcome</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>May-13</td>\n    <td>President of UAE</td>\n    <td>Model boat</td>\n    <td>Over limit</td>\n    <td>Held by Department</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Jun-13</td>\n    <td>Tony Pontone, Albemarle</td>\n    <td>Gallery Art work</td>\n    <td>Over limit</td>\n    <td>Held by Department</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Jun-13</td>\n    <td>President of the United States</td>\n    <td>Jewellery</td>\n    <td>Over limit</td>\n    <td>Held by Department</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Jun-13</td>\n    <td>President of Pakistan</td>\n    <td>Rug</td>\n    <td>Over limit</td>\n    <td>Held by Department</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Jun-13</td>\n    <td>President of Kazakhstan</td>\n    <td>Medals &amp; stamp album</td>\n    <td>Over limit</td>\n    <td>Held by Department</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>A useful trick is to only read a few lines. This makes especially sense when you have a large dataset like the Land Registry&rsquo;s Price Paid Data (several GB in its complete form). </p>\n\n<pre><code>read.csv(\"http://publicdata.landregistry.gov.uk/market-trend-data/price-paid-data/a/pp-complete.csv\", nrow = 10)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>APIs</h3>\n\n<p>R&rsquo;s community has built wrapper packages for many APIs. For example, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/WDI\">World Bank Development indicators</a> are available in R. A quick example with Google&rsquo;s Ngram Viewer is below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is more popular: line charts or line graphs?</strong>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theodi/R-playground/master/line-chart-graph.png\" alt=\"line\" /></p>\n\n<pre><code># Install the package\ninstall.packages(c(\"ngramr\", \"ggplot2\"))\n\n# Load it into R\nlibrary(ngramr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Case-insensitive search\nlines &lt;- ngrami(c(\"line chart\", \"line graph\"), year_start = 1913)\nggplot(lines, aes(Year, Frequency, colour = Phrase)) + theme_minimal() + geom_line(lwd = 1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ropensci.org/related/index.html\">ROpenSci</a> collected an extensive list of R packages that deal with APIs. It includes Twitter, the Guardian, Amazon Mechanical Turk and many more.</p>\n\n<h2>Scraping</h2>\n\n<p>Scraping is an art in itself and is perhaps best left in the hands of experts such as our friends at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://scraperwiki.com/\">ScraperWiki</a>. However, R has support (packages, no surprise here) for popular tools. Worth mentioning is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html\">RCurl</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html\">XML</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cos.name/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Web-Scraping-with-R-XiaoNan.pdf\">Xiao Nan</a> made a useful table of the R scraping toolkit.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/theodi/R-playground/master/available-R-packages.png\" alt=\"packages\" />\n<em>Source: Xiao Nan, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/road2stat\">@road2stat</a></em></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I wished that I&rsquo;d have known about parallelisation options earlier&hellip;\nFor example, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/RCurl/docs/getURIAsynchronous\"><code>getURIAsynchronous</code></a> from RCurl. </p>\n\n<p>I also wrote a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://rpubs.com/statshero/opinion-polls\">tutorial on how to import a HTML table into R</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>What to do next</h2>\n\n<p>Using a tool like R has another great advantage: unlike manually downloading a file, you can easily re-use and share your work. Having some R code instead of an Excel file means your analysis is reproducible and you may be able to adapt it for future projects or if an updated dataset was released.</p>\n\n<p>If you need help you can find support via <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r\">stackoverflow</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.r-project.org/mail.html\">R-help mailing list</a>.

The hope is that it will help other people with a similar itch to scratch, but more than that, that some of those people can help us to make it better - we hold it as axiomatic that there are more good ideas in the world than there are in the ODI.</p>\n\n<h2>The Technical Stuff</h2>\n\n<p>Our applications rely on a bunch of configuration variables (API keys, Oauth tokens, URLs etc) which up until now we&rsquo;ve been storing in our shared password file and passing around between nodes as required. This process is clearly error prone (&ldquo;Why is the Jenkins build broken again?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I forgot to add that new env thing, sorry&rdquo;) and would (as with so many other things) be much better handled by robots. So, let&rsquo;s automate!</p>\n\n<p>Our configuration-management weapon of choice is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opscode.com/chef/\">Chef</a>, which has the concept of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_data_bags.html\">data bags</a>. We&rsquo;ll store our configuration data as JSON in one of these.</p>\n\n<p>So we have a bit of JSON that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  \"id\": \"development\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"capsulecrm\": {\n      \"account_name\": \"foobar\",\n      \"api_token\": \"123abc\",\n      \"default_owner\": \"some_user\"\n    },\n    \"eventbrite\": {\n      \"api_key\": \"456xyz\",\n      \"organizer_id\": \"6031769\",\n      \"user_key\": \"s00pahs3kr3t\"\n    },\n    \"github\": {\n      \"login\": \"user\",\n      \"organisation\": \"theodi\",\n      \"password\": \"icouldtellyoubutthenidhavetokillyou\"\n    },\n    \"leftronic\": {\n      \"api_key\": \"igot99problems\",\n      \"github\": {\n        \"forks\": \"987fgh\",\n        \"issues\": \"asdf1974\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(NOTE: FAKE DATA!!!) Now we&rsquo;re using the rather splendid <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv\">Dotenv</a> gem, which expects to read environment files in either a conventional Unix-ish <em>KEY=value</em> format or, more interestingly for us, a YAML-ish <em>KEY: value</em> style. It&rsquo;s only YAML-<em>ish</em>, though, it doesn&rsquo;t support nesting (AFAIK). We could just stuff the JSON with the raw keys, but doing them hierarchically like this reduces redundancy, improves readability, and makes processing the data a lot more interesting.</p>\n\n<p>So I have this data and I need to turn it into something Dotenv-friendly like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CAPSULECRM_ACCOUNT_NAME: foobar\nCAPSULECRM_API_TOKEN: 123abc\nCAPSULECRM_DEFAULT_OWNER: some_user\nEVENTBRITE_API_KEY: 456xyz\nEVENTBRITE_ORGANIZER_ID: 6031769\nEVENTBRITE_USER_KEY: s00pahs3kr3t\nGITHUB_LOGIN: user\nGITHUB_ORGANISATION: theodi\nGITHUB_PASSWORD: icouldtellyoubutthenidhavetokillyou\nLEFTRONIC_API_KEY: igot99problems\nLEFTRONIC_GITHUB_FORKS: 987fgh\nLEFTRONIC_GITHUB_ISSUES: asdf1974\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which means recursion.</p>\n\n<p>Once, a long time ago, I knew how to do recursion. It&rsquo;s astonishing how completely you can forget things. So, for the benefit of me and anybody else who&rsquo;s stumbled across this because they&rsquo;re having similar problems, here&rsquo;s the solution at which I arrived after several hours of headscratching and Googling:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def walk hash, stack = [], output = []\n  hash.each do |key, val|\n    stack &lt;&lt; key\n    if val.is_a?(Hash)\n      walk val, stack, output\n    else\n      output &lt;&lt; \"%s: %s\" % [\n          stack.join(\"_\").upcase,\n          val\n      ]\n      stack.pop\n    end\n  end\n  stack.pop\n\n  output.join \"\\n\"\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, we pass in our hash, plus two arrays (which default to empty). We step through the top level of the hash, and for each entry, push the key onto our stack, and examine the value. If it&rsquo;s a hash, we go around again, but this time the arrays may contain some stuff: particularly, the stack might have one or more keys in it.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, the value is not a hash, it&rsquo;s a string. We have a winner! So we take our current stack of keys and glue them together, with underscores, into a string, and attach our value, and throw this into our output array. And because we&rsquo;ve now got the value for this (compound) key, we can pop the last value off the stack and bin it.</p>\n\n<p>And now we come to the bit that caused the most swearing: when we&rsquo;ve processed the entire hash, <em>we need to pop the remaining value off the stack</em>. Because I&rsquo;d constructed my test JSON poorly, it all looked superficially successful until I pointed it at the real stuff. There&rsquo;s a lesson there somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s enough CompSci 101.

On the one hand I am hugely excited about my new role within the Transparency and Open Data team (jointly leading on working with departments to get data published and bridging the gap between supply and demand). On the other, it\u2019s very sad to say \u2018goodbye\u2019 to the amazing team at ODI.\u0002\nI genuinely believe that the ODI is something special. Gavin, Nigel, Tim and the team are creating an organisation that is filling a need, has a conscience and ambitions to change the world. The strapline is, after all, \u2018knowledge for everyone\u2019. No mean feat. Lucky they have some great people working there. And when I say great, I mean world class. A lot of the team are well known and, rightly so. They are the epitome of our values: expert, enabling and fearless. Can I also add a few other adjectives? Humble, honest and fun. I think it\u2019s fair to say that I have been inspired, in some way, by each member of the team and, as someone who has been in there from the start, it\u2019s been great seeing everyone come together and, quite simply, gell.\u0002\nMy position has been unique. I\u2019ve been here from the start and treated as part of the team but I\u2019ve always known I\u2019d be returning to the Cabinet Office at Easter. An outsider on the inside. It\u2019s been a real insight to see how a start-up team grows from scratch and I\u2019ve learnt a lot to take back to the Cabinet Office in terms of adopting ways of working which will support an open culture. In a previous job, we tried to instill an organisational culture of \u2018do as we do\u2019. ODI exemplifies this. The organisation is non-hierarchical and open. Everyone\u2019s opinions matter, comments and suggestions are listened to and considered. Giving feedback and support is part of the course. All of this probably sounds quite easy but consider the fact that a lot of these people didn\u2019t know each other a few months or weeks ago, the size and scope of the agenda and the number of organisations that genuinely behave in such a way and I think this becomes more impressive. And inspirational. This is how the team has been working from the start when there were just a handful of people. These are very positive behaviours which have helped me with my personal development. I would hope that everyone who collaborates with the ODI is exposed to this and it serves to foster greater support and trust across our stakeholders and networks.\u0002\nOne of the most striking things about the team is that they instill confidence. When you meet them you know these are the kind of people who get things done. They are a small team and they have a LOT to do but with a collective resume that includes doctorates, entrepreneurship, government knowledge, commercial nous, vast technical knowledge, creativity and a good dose of common sense, I know they can deliver.\u0002\nSo, thank you, ODIes*, for having me as part of the team and for inspiring me. It\u2019s been brilliant.\u0002\n*\u2019ODIes\u2019 is the collective noun for people working at ODI and was first coined by super temp Edwina Bowles.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Olivia Burman","slug":"olivia-burman","web_url":"http://theodi.org/olivia-burman","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Olivia Burman","slug":"olivia-burman","web_url":"http://theodi.org/olivia-burman","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/introducing-csvlint.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/introducing-csvlint","slug":"introducing-csvlint","title":"Introducing CSVLint","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:05+01:00","created_at":"2014-04-15T09:15:02+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"The ODI tech team has recently been building a tool to validate CSV files.

While CSV is a very simple format, it is surprisingly easy to create files that are hard for others to use. </p>\n\n<p>The tool we&rsquo;ve created is called <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/\">CSVLint</a> and this blog post provides some background on why we&rsquo;ve built the tool, its key features, and why we think it can help improve the quality of a large amount of open data.</p>\n\n<h2>Why build a CSV validator?</h2>\n\n<p>Jeni Tennison recently described 2014 as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/2014-the-year-of-csv\">the Year of CSV</a>. A lot, perhaps even the majority, of Open Data is published in the tabular format CSV. CSV has many short-comings, but is very widely supported and can be easy to use.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately though, lots of CSV data is published in broken and inconsistent ways. There are numerous reasons why this happens, but two of the key issues are that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>tools differ in how they produce or expect to consume CSV data, leading to the creation of many different variants or &ldquo;dialects&rdquo; of CSV that have different delimiters, escape characters, encoding, etc</li>\n  <li>lots of data is dumped from spreadsheets that are designed for human-reading and not automated processing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This case study on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/the-status-of-csvs-on-datagovuk\">the status of CSVs on data.gov.uk</a> highlights the size of this issue: only a third of the data was machine-readable.</p>\n\n<p>These types of issues can be addressed by better tooling. Validation tools can help guide data publishers towards best practices providing them with a means to check data before it is published to ensure it is usable. Validation tools can also help re-users check data before it is consumed and provide useful feedback to publishers on issues.</p>\n\n<p>This is the motivation behind CSVLint.</p>\n\n<h2>Gathering Requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To ensure that we were building a tool that would meet the needs of a variety of users, we gathered requirements from several sources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A <strong>user workshop</strong> &ndash; we engaged with a group of data publishers and re-users to discuss the issues they faced and the features they would like to see. The attendees identified and prioritised a potential set of features for the tool</li>\n  <li><strong>background research</strong> &ndash; we <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csv-validation-research\">explored</a> a range of different tools, techniques and formats for validating and describing CSV files. This allowed us to identify the types of validation that might be useful and ways to describe constraints and create schemas</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We used this input to refine an initial set of features which formed the backlog for the project. The key things that we needed to deliver were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a CSV syntax validator to check that the basic structure of a CSV file</li>\n  <li>an extended validator that could check a CSV file against a schema, e.g. to ensure that it contained the correct columns with the correct data types</li>\n  <li>a way to generate documentation for schemas, to make it easy for people to publish and aggregate data in common formats</li>\n  <li>a tool that can be used to check data both before and after publication</li>\n  <li>clear guidance on how to fix identified problems</li>\n  <li>integration options for embedding these tools into other various workflows</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The CSVLint Alpha</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4d/22/534d22121f986a2ef0000182/csvlint-home.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"attachment-534d2212d0d4623a4a000003\" /></p>\n\n<p>The end result of our efforts is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/\">CSVLint</a> an open service that supports the validation of CSV files published in a variety of ways. </p>\n\n<p>The service is made up of two components. The web application provides all of the user facing functionality, including the reporting, etc. It is backed by an underlying software library, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csvlint.rb\">csvlint.rb</a>, that does all of the heavy lifting around data validation. </p>\n\n<p>Both <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csvlint\">the web application</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csvlint.rb\">the library</a> are open source.

This allows publishers to validate and improve their data files before making them public. </p>\n\n<p>All other data is deemed to be public and validation reports are added to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/validation\">the list of recent validations</a>. This provides a feedback loop to help highlight common errors.</p>\n\n<h2>Validation Reports</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/4d/21/534d21a1f362be6c87000152/csvlint.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"attachment-534d21a1d0d4623a4a000002\" /></p>\n\n<p>The validation reports (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/validation/5343d38a6373760715770000\">example</a>) have been designed to give &ldquo;at a glance&rdquo; feedback on the results, as well as a detailed breakdown of each issue.</p>\n\n<p>All feedback is classified along two different dimensions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Type of feedback\n    <ul>\n      <li>Error &ndash; problems that needs to be fixed for the CSV to be considered valid</li>\n      <li>Warning &ndash; problems that should be fixed, but aren&rsquo;t critical</li>\n      <li>Message &ndash; additional feedback on areas for improvement or assumptions made during the validation</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Category of error\n    <ul>\n      <li>Structure &ndash; problems with the syntax of the file, e.g. problems with quoting or delimiters</li>\n      <li>Schema &ndash; issues caused by schema validation failures</li>\n      <li>Context &ndash; problems related to how the data has been published, e.g. the <code>Content-Type</code> used to serve the file</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The summary table for each validation result is supplemented with detailed feedback on every reported issue with suggested improvements.</p>\n\n<p>The report also includes badges that allow a summary result and a link to a full report to be embedded in other web applications. </p>\n\n<p>A <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/validation/5343d38a6373760715770000.json\">JSON view</a> of a validation result provides other integration options.</p>\n\n<h2>Schema Validation</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to checking structural problems with CSV files, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/\">CSVLint</a> service can also validate a file against a schema.</p>\n\n<p>We proposed some suggested improvements to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema\">JSON Table Schema</a> format that would allow <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/#field-constraints\">constraints</a> to be expressed for individual fields in a table, e.g. minimum length, patterns, etc. These have now been incorporated into the latest version of the specification.</p>\n\n<p>CSVLint currently supports schemas based on the latest version of JSON Table Schema. There is some background <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/about\">in the documentation</a> (see &ldquo;How To Write a Schema&rdquo;) and it is possible to see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/schemas\">a list of recently used schemas</a> to view further examples.</p>\n\n<p>Using a schema it is possible to perform additional checks, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>whether the columns have the right name</li>\n  <li>required fields are populated</li>\n  <li>fields have a minimum or maximum length, or match a pattern</li>\n  <li>field values are unique</li>\n  <li>values match a declared type, e.g. a date</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This provides a lot of flexibility for checking the data contained in a CSV file. When validating a file a user may specify a schema file to be used when validating the data, either uploading it with the data or pointing to an existing schema that has been published to the web. For <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/\">Data Packages</a> any built-in schema is automatically applied. Schemas can be uploaded along with a data file or published openly on the web.</p>\n\n<p>CSVLint automatically generates some summary documentation for schemas loaded from the web, e.g. this <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/schemas/530b16c163737676e9260000\">schema for the Land Registry Price Paid data</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>How CSVLint can make a difference</h2>\n\n<p>While CSLint is still an alpha release there are already a rich set of features available to support guiding and improving data publication. We think that the service can potentially play a number of roles:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>by helping users of all kinds improve the data they are publishing via a quick feedback loop that will guide them on fixing errors</li>\n  <li>enabling communities to publish schemas that describe and validate data formats to simplify the aggregation of open data</li>\n  <li>supporting data re-users in checking source data to catch common problems and provide useful constructive feedback to data publishers</li>\n  <li>allowing data repositories to use CSVLint badges in their service to provide immediate feedback to both publishers and re-users on data quality</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But to prove this we need people to start using the tool. User feedback will provide us with useful guidance on how the service might evolve. So we&rsquo;re really keen to get feedback on how well CSVLint supports your particular data publication or re-use use case. </p>\n\n<p>Please try out the service and share your experience by leaving a comment on this blog post.

So, he walked over and asked if there was anything the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ukoditech\">tech team</a> knew of that would give him more space to work with.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t quite as simple as just having a load of disk space. This is important stuff, so backup is important, and ideally we should be able to access it from the outside. We also have no system administrator (or air conditioning in the server room), so it couldn&rsquo;t be anything that needed much maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;d heard of things like the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/\">Amazon Storage Gateway</a>, and the idea of local storage backed by infinite cloud storage was very appealing. However, we don&rsquo;t use AWS; instead, we love <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rackspace.co.uk\">Rackspace</a>. Not only are they one of our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://directory.theodi.org/members/AR6346HB\">sponsors</a>, but they&rsquo;re <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/openstack/\">big on open source</a>, and their London data centre runs on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rackspace.co.uk/green-hosting\">100% renewable energy</a>, all of which make us happy.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there wasn&rsquo;t anything around that we could use as a storage appliance backed by Rackspace Cloudfiles, which was a problem. Then, we realised - using a little bit of code and some cheap hardware, we could make our own!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://theodi.github.io/presentations/philbot/philbot.jpg\" alt=\"Philbot\" /></p>\n\n<p>So, this is Philbot. It&rsquo;s pretty simple, hardware wise. It&rsquo;s a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\">Raspberry Pi</a> with a 2TB Seagate USB hard disk attached, which it shares over the network using the usual network drive protocols. All in all, under a \u00a3100. Not bad.</p>\n\n<p>The magic is in the software. We&rsquo;re a Ruby shop mostly, and there are some amazing open source gems out there that let us do most of this really easily.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, our code uses the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/guard/listen\">Listen</a> gem to watch the filesystem and detect when things change. The idea is that when <em>real</em> Phil saves a file onto Philbot&rsquo;s disk, the script will notice. If a file is added, modified, or deleted, then it&rsquo;s placed onto a queue (using <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/resque/resque\">Resque</a>). That queue is processed in the background, and the file is uploaded or removed from Cloudfiles as appropriate using the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/fog/fog\">fog</a> gem. All in all, it&rsquo;s really very little code, mostly just glue to connect together the parts. It&rsquo;s all test driven with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber\">Cucumber</a> as well, another of our favourite tools.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, it works. Human Phil can save files on a large network drive, and they will be instantly backed up to Cloudfiles. If he deletes them, they will be removed from Cloudfiles as well. In future, we want to add a function to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; directories, which removes them from the local storage but leaves them in the cloud for long-term cold storage. </p>\n\n<p>There are some other future plans; we want to make the configuration of the device itself operate using a network drive with a configuration file on it, and then create a Raspberry Pi OS image with it all preconfigured, so that you can just plug it in and get going. That&rsquo;s in the future though; for now it&rsquo;s handling our day to day needs nicely.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you would like to have your own cloud storage appliance for less than a hundred quid, why not take a look at the detailed setup instructions in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/philbot/\">Philbot repository on GitHub</a>.

In a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-post-shifting-environments-at-the-odi\">previous post</a> I offered some reflections on my experiences as an intern here. Now I want to share more of the &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of my research.</p>\n\n<p>I began this project with a background in political studies and a keen interest in Open Data\u2019s (potential) benefits. Informing my work additionally with experience gained through my Masters degree in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/cerch/study/madam/index.aspx\">Digital Asset Management (DAM)</a>, I sought to approach this research as an Open Data outsider: I was interested in how the \u201cgeneral public\u201d (that amorphous concept of basically\u2026 everyone) could engage with the data being opened by their governments. I started with the understanding that, in our democratic societies, the <em>government&rsquo;s</em> data is the <em>people&rsquo;s</em> data. </p>\n\n<p>I endeavoured to examine the UK\u2019s Open Government Data environment from the horse\u2019s mouth. My research focus was firstly on material produced by the government (such as the extremely useful <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-the-potential\">Open Data White Paper</a>) My secondary research focus was on material about the government\u2019s Open Data approaches (such as the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\">Shakespeare Review</a>). The aim of this approach - balancing government discourse with non-government content - was again to address the linkage between the government and &ldquo;the people&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<h3>Low engagement</h3>\n\n<p>My findings (informed, for example, by the Cabinet Office\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/\">Digital Landscape Research</a>, data.gov.uk <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/blog/site-usage\">site usage information</a>, and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.listpoint.co.uk/Attachments/Listpoint%20research%20rel%20final.pdf\">&ldquo;Inaugural Public Sector Benchmark Survey on Open Data&rdquo;</a>) indicated that public participation in the use of Open Government Data - direct engagement with government data by the populace - is limited, specialised, and low. </p>\n\n<p>Open Data engagement tends to come from specialised actors - developers, entrepreneurs, some business specialists, and other tech-savvy agents. But if government data is indeed the people&rsquo;s data, then evidently there should be a desire to widen this engagement. The Uk government has in fact professed the desire, in this regard, to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/video/2013/apr/29/can-government-data-change-the-world-post-event-video\">widen participation</a>. Likewise, the United Nations <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://workspace.unpan.org/sites/Internet/Documents/Guidenlines%20on%20OGDCE%20May17%202013.pdf\">has argued</a> that such engagement is a human right. </p>\n\n<p>So, what might be causing such low participation? Ultimately, addressing this question is the first essential step towards any attempt to expand engagement. Laying the foundations through this question I explored four basic issues that appear to be hampering the expansion of Open Participation:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Data/information conflation</h3>\n\n<p>I was wary to begin my work with such an epistemological point, but the government\u2019s conflation of notions of data and notions of information seems to be causing something of a \u201cfirst lap\u201d participation stumbling block. The government\u2019s definition of Open Government Data - as found in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-the-potential\">Open Data White Paper</a> - describes making \u201cPublic Sector Information\u201d (PSI) open. </p>\n\n<p>PSI is both data - what the government defines as symbols that are \u201cnot the product of analysis or interpretation\u201d - and information - what the government defines as that developed through a \u201cprocess that summarises, interprets or otherwise represents data to convey meaning\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>It may seem trivial, but this sort of basic definitional conflation requires ongoing examination and questioning. If Open Government Data is both data <em>and</em> information, how is it to be used? In what way(s)? Does Open Government Data exist as non-analysed symbols or as processed answers to questions? Can it (comprehensibly) be both at once? </p>\n\n<h3>2. Audience</h3>\n\n<p>Issue one is epistemological, but issue two certainly is not and stems directly from the data/information conflation: Who is Open Government Data for? </p>\n\n<p>The UK government is fond of saying \u201ceveryone\u201d, \u201cthe people\u201d, \u201cbusinesses\u201d, \u201cusers\u201d, or similar catch-all terms. Targeting Open Government Data (or anything, for that matter) at \u201ceveryone\u201d or at under-defined and -understood audience groups raises a serious concern: not everyone is the same. </p>\n\n<p>Different people have different needs, abilities, and desires. One \u201cproduct\u201d (Open Government Data <em>en masse</em>) will not meet the needs of \u201ceveryone\u201d. If Open Government Data doesn\u2019t speak to - or attempt to speak to - a particular person\u2019s needs and abilities, why should they engage with it?</p>\n\n<h3>3. Intermediaries</h3>\n\n<p>The UK Open Government Data environment is reliant on the work of intermediaries: specialist actors who manipulate raw data into processed outcomes (e.g. apps). As the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/video/2013/apr/29/can-government-data-change-the-world-post-event-video\">Cabinet Office\u2019s Director of Transparency and Open Data put it</a>: \u201cthe default model is we get the data out, developers do their stuff, and the public benefits through that\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>But, as even he admits, this is suboptimal from the point of view of assisting citizens with their right to engage with <em>their</em> public data. </p>\n\n<p>The government is not preventing people from participating. However, participation is low and the environment relies on specialist users who develop raw data into more widely usable information outputs.</p>\n\n<p>The layers that develop between the people and their public data (data/information conflation, audience confusion, intermediary actors) are apparent.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Overemphasis on data supply</h3>\n\n<p>Too much emphasis is placed by the UK government on the supply of data and not enough focus is placed on understanding, generating, and nurturing data demand or data use. If public data is seen as the people&rsquo;s own data, it seems essential that all stages of its lifecycle - production, publication, consumption - be equally nourished.</p>\n\n<p>To accompany the Shakespeare Review, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/198905/bis-13-743-market-assessment-of-public-sector-information.pdf\">Deloitte produced a market assessment report</a>, which included an illustration of the UK\u2019s current Open Government Data environment. </p>\n\n<p>The diagram below is a redrawing of part of Deloitte&rsquo;s illustration. It is notable how the government sits at the supply end of a linear flow. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/8d/e9/528de926f362be664f00006a/Screen_shot_2013-11-21_at_11.05.47.png\" alt=\"Alt\" /></p>\n\n<p>There are good mechanisms in place to enable data requests - a way of pushing against the one way flow. However, even these are still about data release: getting this feedback only enables the government to push more data out, it does not address the usability or demand of this data (the right hand side of this diagram).</p>\n\n<h3>Digital ecosystem reconceptualisation</h3>\n\n<p>In my paper I offered a reconceptualisation of the UK\u2019s current Open Government Data environment. I based this on the thinking of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_ecosystem\">digital ecosystems</a>, which I saw as &ldquo;the digital counterparts of biological ecosystems&rdquo; (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4205344\">Brisco and De Wilde</a>): as cyclical, sustainable, demand-driven environments oriented around the agents of various species who are mutually interdependent in the delivery of effective and efficient value (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://nparc.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/npsi/ctrl\">Boley and Chang</a>; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2011/03/31/building-the-open-data-ecosystem/\">Pollock</a>; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/4/900\">Harrison, Pardo, and Cook</a>). </p>\n\n<p>I sought to conceptualise the environment using this metaphorical framework. I did not attempt to change the environment or stipulate policy changes, but rather to provide a theoretical framework within which the system as it exists could be reexamined.</p>\n\n<p>My reconceptualisation, in a nutshell, was about ascribing more appreciation to the \u201cthings\u201d of Open Government Data, the \u201cdoers\u201d of Open Government Data, and the process that relate these to each other. </p>\n\n<p>Using digital ecosystem terminology, I offered an understanding of the environment as being made up of clear and distinct (but related):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>entities</strong> (data and information) and </li>\n  <li><strong>agents</strong> (the government, intermediaries, and other actors including the public, businesses, and community groups).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I assert that, much as in a biological ecosystem, these entities and agents should all interact, interrelate, and benefit from one another. This is illustrated below.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/8d/ea/528dea31d0d4622bf5000074/Screen_shot_2013-11-21_at_11.10.20.png\" alt=\"Alt\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>Thinking about Open Government Data as a biological ecosystem is useful. Taking the biological foundations, agents can be imagined as sharks and whales (just as an example!) and entities as crustaceans and fish. A whale needs crustaceans for its sustenance, but sharks require fish and will not thrive if they can only eat crustaceans. </p>\n\n<p>In this example, there is a clear distinction between the demands of various agents - between the demands of the whales and the demands of the sharks. The whole ecosystem interrelates (crustaceans-fish-sharks-whales), exists as one, and relies on feedbacks and interdependencies. Crucially, the system is not dualised: there aren&rsquo;t just \u201cfood\u201d entities and \u201cdiner\u201d entities. Instead, there are <em>types</em> of food and <em>types</em> of diners: some food entities can be diner entities and some diners can become food. </p>\n\n<p>I applied this structure of interrelationships and interdependencies, supported by clear differentiations, to my thinking of the Open Government Data environment. This is about distinguishing between data and information (so that there is clarity about who might use which entity for what purpose) and between various agents: all are connected, nominally equal, and inter-reliant. </p>\n\n<p>The concept behind this framework is that government does not have to only push data to intermediaries, who push information to consumers. Instead, it is possible for all agents to have the ability to interrelate more dynamically. </p>\n\n<p>Fundamentally, this is about a frame of mind and operation. This is about seeing the Open Government Data environment as one in which greater interrelationships - and wider <em>direct participation</em> - are possible. </p>\n\n<p>When the core of the ecosystem is an inherently shared resource (government data being the people&rsquo;s public data) this is essential. It is essential for the rights of the agents and it is essential for the healthy and sustainable survival of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3>OpenDataCommunities</h3>\n\n<p>To illustrate this theoretical argument, I made considerable use of the excellent linked data portal developed by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government\">Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG)</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The department&rsquo;s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/\">Open Data Communities</a> site, in contrast to the government\u2019s central data portal, operates with a considerable degree of digital ecosystems thinking. On this site data and information are distinguished while still being provided through a single access point. </p>\n\n<p>The screenshot below illustrates this. Note the online viewable data and downloadable CSV data: casual users can get data easily, without a big download, while from the same source a more involved and technically-inclined agent (e.g. a developer) can access and manipulate a CSV download.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/8d/eb/528deb45d0d4622bf5000076/Screen_shot_2013-11-21_at_11.14.33.png\" alt=\"Alt\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>The re-conceptualisations I put forward in my paper are not big, but they are significant. </p>\n\n<p>Government data is the people\u2019s data. It is vital to ensure that as many people as possible can access their data and use their data. This means ironing out some of the ongoing and foundational issues at the heart of the current Open Government Data environment. This will ultimately benefit the rights of people to engage with their data. This will also benefit the environment as a whole: as in an ecosystem, sustainability will be bolstered through the interrelated engagement of all agents.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Fred Saunderson","slug":"fred-saunderson","web_url":"http://theodi.org/fred-saunderson","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Fred Saunderson","slug":"fred-saunderson","web_url":"http://theodi.org/fred-saunderson","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/keep-paf-public.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/keep-paf-public","slug":"keep-paf-public","title":"Keep PAF Public","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:24+01:00","created_at":"2013-02-01T15:32:17+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"One of the key things you quickly realise when working with data is that some data is dramatically more useful than other data.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p>One of the key things you quickly realise when working with data is that some data is dramatically more useful than other data.</p>\n\n<p>The Postcode Address File (PAF) is one of those dramatically useful datasets. It enables you to find a postcode for a given address, or find the range of addresses that have a given postcode.

This post provides some background on our position.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of public registers is to make information available to the public. It used to be that such public registers could be inspected by anyone but were only accessible (as paper copies) in particular places, such as council buildings or local libraries.</p>\n\n<p>As computing and the internet have spread, public registers are now generally published online, which in general makes it easier for people to view those registers. However, this is only the first step in providing better access. We believe that if they are to serve their purpose, by default, public registers should be available as open data, namely:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in a machine-readable format</li>\n  <li>under an open licence</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A machine-readable register can be manipulated on a computer. Think of the difference between a table in a PDF document and a spreadsheet. You can read a table in a PDF and search it, but a spreadsheet can be sorted, filtered and graphed. This makes it easier for people to extract the information they are interested in from the register. It also makes it easier to analyse the register to create new insights.</p>\n\n<p>Machine-readability removes the <em>technical</em> barriers to processing information in a public register. An open licence removes the <em>legal</em> barriers. An explicit open licence reassures people who want to work with the data within a public register that they can do so. It permits them to reuse and republish the register, with few constraints (such as attribution). It ensures that everyone can use the information in the register; that there will be no privileged access to the information that it contains.</p>\n\n<p>The government creates new public registers only rarely. When it does, as in the Lobbying Bill, we would like to see its publication as open data being given a firm legal footing. The legislation should say that the register:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>must be published online</li>\n  <li>must be held in a machine-readable format</li>\n  <li>must contain certain basic information</li>\n  <li>must be available under an open licence</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Business reusers of open data need guarantees about its long term availability. Legislation is a great way for the government to provide these long term guarantees \u2014 legal obligations are significantly stronger than policy statements.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of the other issues with the Lobbying Bill, and indeed with the scope and content of the register itself, we believe that the current wording of the Bill misses an opportunity to make a firm commitment to open data and transparency.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/machine-readable-rights-statements.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/machine-readable-rights-statements","slug":"machine-readable-rights-statements","title":"Machine Readable Rights Statements","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:54+01:00","created_at":"2013-06-25T16:26:03+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"As the open data movement continues to mature, discussion is focusing on how the publishing and use of open data can be become more sustainable.

In fact doing so is key criteria for reaching each level of certification.</p>\n\n<p>There are several existing efforts to help standardise dataset metadata, including the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-dataset\">W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary</a>\u0002(DCAT).

local government touches all aspects of our lives, from education to care for the elderly, it&rsquo;s a constant presence.</p>\n\n<p>This is why it&rsquo;s important that local government makes good use of open data, as organisations that are so key to the lives of so many people need\u0002to be open and accountable.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind (and as an ex-local government bod myself), I was pleased to represent the ODI at the recent <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/events/-/journal_content/56/10171/3863451/EVENT-TEMPLATE\">Making Transparency Work For You</a> conference in Leeds.</p>\n\n<p>This event bought people from across the North East and North West to see what was happening on the national stage, as well as examples of upcoming projects and good practice locally.</p>\n\n<p>From a national perspective, Ed Parkes from the Cabinet Office talked about policy developments including the strengthening of the Freedom of Information Act to include a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/legislation/protection-freedoms-bill/\">Right to Data</a> and Gesche Schmid from the Local Government Association talked about, amongst other things, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/New-funding-to-accelerate-benefits-of-open-data-684c1.aspx\">Breakthrough Fund</a>, a pot of money designed to help councils publish data in new and innovative ways.</p>\n\n<p>There was also talk about making data linkable and sharable by using common standards from Paul Davidson from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legsb.gov.uk/\">Local eGovernment Standards Body</a>, and Mike Thacker from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.esd.org.uk/esdtoolkit/default.aspx\">esd-Toolkit</a> spoke about some of the standards that are already being used to link up datasets from across government.</p>\n\n<p>Steve Peters from the Department for Communities and Local Government also showcased <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/data\">open data communities</a>, a linked data store for statistics about local government which is collected nationally, and is already\u0002beginning to be used and linked with other datasets by councils such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://linkeddata.hants.gov.uk/land-supply-mapper/map.html\">Hampshire</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://lambeth-in-numbers.co.uk\">Lambeth</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The most interesting take away for me, however, was seeing the work that has been done by councils locally, such as Trafford, who have used open data in partnership with local communities to identify areas that are in need of funding and use that data to support funding applications.</p>\n\n<p>It was also interesting to see councils around Sheffield joining together and engaging with the open data communties in their region, as well as identifying common datasets that they could all open up in a common format (which is a great way to begin to adopt standards).</p>\n\n<p>Overall I was struck by how much innovation is going on in the sector, and how much open data work has been done\u0002since I left local government (only eight\u0002weeks ago!).

Literacy rates in Pakistan are stagnant at 58% of the population, with only 50% of the rural population ever attending school. Two-thirds of those out-of-school are girls. Primary net enrolment has risen from 58% to 74%, but this hides tremendous variation. Only 17% of people have ever been to school in Punjab while 37% have attended in Balochistan.</p>\n\n<p>And even these statistics hide tremendous variation in reporting. Some estimates put out-of-school children at 10 million in Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, then, a concerted effort is required to ensure that the best approaches to improving education outcomes are recognised and used to improve results elsewhere in Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.alifailaan.pk/\">Alif Ailaan</a>, an education research and advocacy organisation in Pakistan, has been working with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.htspe.com/\">HTSPE</a>, an international social and economic development consultancy, and funded by DFID, to build a convincing set of case studies and research to drive education improvement.</p>\n\n<p>One way they have begun to do this is to open up research studies looking at Pakistan&rsquo;s education system and present that in a user-friendly fashion. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dillinger.io/index.php/case-studies/9-case-studies-education-outcomes-transparency-from-research-data-in-pakistan\">Whythawk has </a>been supporting the project. Our work includes building <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-basiccharts\">extensions to the CKAN</a> open data publishing platform to allow <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dashboard\">data-driven dashboards</a> for online advocacy. I&rsquo;ve just returned from a week in Islamabad with the enthusiastic professionals driving the Pakistan Education Portal training them on how to use the portal.</p>\n\n<p>Their drive is clear: work with existing research institutes and programs to release their data so that other researchers can perform meta-studies, develop new and useful insight, and so drive meaningful change.</p>\n\n<p>It is a useful and timely answer to the question: why should I release my data?</p>\n\n<p>The term &ldquo;open data&rdquo; has become somewhat loaded, but \u2013 to simplify \u2013 means that data are accessible without limitation in some standardised and machine-readable form.</p>\n\n<p>Organisations which intend to aggregate, reflect, and present analysis on published data from different sources should not be confronted with a tsunami of licence conditions in order to do so. National statistical data which demands that &ldquo;An electronic copy of all reports and publications based on the requested data will be sent to the National Data Archive,&rdquo; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pages/terms\">for instance</a>, places a massive burden on future users of that data.</p>\n\n<p>It must be recognised, though, that releasing and maintaining such data is a perpetual and costly business. Many national governments have signed up, but implementation lags.</p>\n\n<p>Tim Berners-Lee has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.digital.telefonica.com/2013/10/09/tim-berners-lee-telefonica-open-agenda/\">spoken eloquently</a> <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/09/raw-data\">about the benefits</a> of &ldquo;raw data&rdquo; and why governments should release it. &ldquo;The information about spending, agriculture, health and education that lies behind locked databases could be used to dramatically improve people&rsquo;s lives. When governments begin to release data openly on the web, the growing movement of hackers and activists and even internal government agencies and corporations, can begin to use the previously unconnected and undissected numbers, images and graphs to create new ways for you to access valuable new information.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>While there are stories of open data being used, far too many are mundane. Many, such as maps to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://findtoilet.dk/\">nearest toilet</a>, or where you can walk your dog, are hardly reasons for governments to pay attention. Numerous public and commercial services already provide such information.</p>\n\n<p>The few stories that are compelling, however, are very compelling.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.sarpam.net/\">The Southern African Regional Programme on Access to Medicines and Diagnostic</a>s, for example, used open access to medicine pricing to develop a regional study. They found some governments were being charged up to 25 times more for the same drugs. A <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/7192271.stm\">similar exercise in the UK</a> looking at which statins, a commonly-used cholesterol-lowering drug, were being prescribed by doctors, indicated that simply changing to generics could save the fiscus \u00a370 million a year, or enough to employ 2,000 nurses.</p>\n\n<p>And then there&rsquo;s our work at Whythawk, supporting the team at Alif Ailaan in Pakistan. I believe that, after their service goes live in June, and as their data are consolidated, new insights will drive better outcomes for youngsters there.</p>\n\n<p>These are big projects, and the world is still filled with major challenges which can only be resolved through institutional funding and major professional effort. Supporting farmers in rural African villages to adapt their crops for climate change. Improving healthcare outcomes. Education. Many of these are being driven by opportunities for open access research publication.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is also true that the open data industry will only reach maturity when thousands of enterprises are able to build profitable businesses from a reliable source of open access and public data.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, consulting services like Whythawk are part of that commercial impetus for open data. But neither is this a movement limited exclusively to the developed nations.</p>\n\n<p>Linet Kwamboka, a founder at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://datascience.co.ke/\">DataScience in Kenya</a>, is in the business of aggregating open data from various sources while creating relationships across sectors to mainly help businesses and investors understand where opportunities and great returns are. She explains the business advantage as, &ldquo;If as an investor you wanted to invest in flower farming in Kenya for example, do you do it in Nakuru county because that is where everyone is doing it or is there another county in Kenya that has more favourable climate, manpower and proximity for the activity? We help you make the right decision with lower risk.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This is a fantastic start and I wish her every success. Importantly, the more initiatives like this, along with the big global development initiatives, the better the case for open data becomes.</p>\n\n<p>Five years after Tim Berners-Lee got a roomful of people to chant <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web\">&ldquo;raw data now&rdquo; at TED</a>, we are finally building up good reasons why data owners should listen.</p>\n\n<p>Gavin Chait is Lead Consultant at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.whythawk.com/\">Whythawk</a>, an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/membership\">ODI supporter</a>.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"Member blog: An answer in Pakistan to \u2018what is open data for?\u2019","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Gavin Chait","slug":"gavin-chait","web_url":"http://theodi.org/gavin-chait","tag_ids":["members"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Gavin Chait","slug":"gavin-chait","web_url":"http://theodi.org/gavin-chait","tag_ids":["members"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data","slug":"member-blog-creating-fruitful-partnerships-open-data","title":"Member blog: Creating fruitful partnerships with open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:02+01:00","created_at":"2013-09-10T10:52:18+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The success of online dating is predicated on the fact that people are willing to display public information about themselves, even though they might feel uncomfortable doing it.

Many people have this fear that someone they know will see them and think they are losers, whereas in fact, revealing what makes them tick is what actually brings them value (a date). The same applies to open innovation around data: companies need to expose themselves to attract potential partners.</p>\n\n<p>Last June, our company, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.snips.net\">Snips</a>, launched its latest product, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.tranquilien.com\">Tranquilien</a>, a mobile app that lets Parisian commuters know in advance how full trains will be so that they can pick one where they can sit. By all metrics, the launch was a success: 200 press articles, 3 TV coverages, 5 radio interviews, 2 conferences and 1 national open data award. Overnight, we had a successful mobile app, a track record, credibility and tremendous visibility. How did we do it? Quite simply by partnering with the French national railway, SNCF!</p>\n\n<p>After our smart transit app prototype won the SNCF open data hackathon, we decided to actually build the product and launch it. What we soon realized though was that we weren&rsquo;t only building a mobile app; we were creating the first ever indicator of commuting comfort! With this information, passengers could now choose their train based on how comfortable they want to be. With enough people using it, the load would be spread across more trains, effectively reducing &ndash; if not eliminating &ndash; peak hours.</p>\n\n<p>Excited by this new prospect, SNCF decided to allocate more resources to the project, giving us full access to key private data that proved essential for the success of the project.</p>\n\n<p>In this particular case though, the available open data was not enough. We needed access to sensitive data such as historical passenger counts and equipment allocation schedules. We needed train specifications and stations&rsquo; architectural plans. We needed real-time train information.</p>\n\n<p>The need to access private data actually appeared in virtually every project we did. Every single partner and client we worked with was sitting on amazing datasets that could be turned into disruptive new products. When asked why they weren\u2019t opening them, we got responses ranging from &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have an open data culture&rdquo;, to &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know if we are legally allowed to&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>More troubling perhaps, is the fact that startups relying on open data aren&rsquo;t showing the way either. Not a single one is opening their user, sensor or app data. Why? Because data is a highly valuable asset and businesses would rather turn a profit from it than give it away for free. To be honest, you can&rsquo;t really blame them. When you spend considerable resources gathering, cleaning, validating and analysing data, you want to get some sort of return from it. Of course, open data brings tremendous value to companies actively engaging in it but the best strategy is not always obvious, and private companies often require additional safeguards to preserve their competitiveness.</p>\n\n<p>What really matters here isn&rsquo;t the fact that data is opened. It&rsquo;s the fact that it is made accessible. Indeed, startups like us only need to be aware of who is producing what data, and how we can access it. Just like for online dating, large companies only need to give information about themselves, the data they hold, the market they are after and what products they are looking for, so that a match with an innovative company can be made! Basically, we need a data matching portal, a global platform where data can be declared, exchanged and partnerships started so that we can all spend time doing something we love: building products.</p>\n\n<p><em>Snips is has joined the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://directory.theodi.org/members\">ODI membership programme</a></em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Rand Hindi","slug":"rand-hindi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/rand-hindi","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Rand Hindi","slug":"rand-hindi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/rand-hindi","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/member-blog-introducing-importio.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/member-blog-introducing-importio","slug":"member-blog-introducing-importio","title":"Member blog: Introducing Import:io","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:00+01:00","created_at":"2013-08-26T16:52:40+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"In the first of a series of blogs by our members, Bea Schofield of Import:io explains why her company shares the ODI\u2019s commitment to open data.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p><em>In the first of a series of blogs by our members, Bea Schofield of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://import.io/\">Import:io</a> explains why her company shares the ODI&rsquo;s commitment to open data.</em></p>\n\n<p>Since the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/mar/09/education.epublic\">\u2018Free Our Data\u2019 campaign</a> by the Guardian in 2006 highlighting the potential benefits of making government data available, a wider \u2018open data culture\u2019 has been flourishing. However, in spite of an ever-increasing amount of data on the web, what can be classed as \u2018open data\u2019 continues to account for a very small percentage of the gold mine.</p>\n\n<p>Quantifying the social and economic value of data which is available but not \u2018open\u2019 is no easy task. In fact, it is probably as easy as persuading everyone who publishes data to build an API to the source so the data can be retrieved in a structured format. The major stumbling block is there are no obvious incentives for people to make their data open. It requires expensive developer time and the rewards are seemingly few and far between. Translating data which is available on the web into truly \u2018open\u2019 data requires technological innovation, advocacy and a set of incentives for data owners \u2013 a task <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://import.io/\">import.io</a> is working closely with the ODI to undertake.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://import.io/\">Import.io</a> provides a technological solution to the \u2018open data\u2019 problem with its easy-to-use data extraction tool, giving anyone the opportunity to turn the web into a database without writing any code. Empowering a community of data users to generate and share structured data from the web frees the data, but then comes the more shady area of licensing and accountability. Despite being the public domain, data owners still have the right to determine how their content is re-used.</p>\n\n<p>Educating people who own and publish data on the benefits of freeing their data is another piece in the puzzle, and one which the ODI is leading. As data owners are made aware of the innovative ways in which their data can be used and the profit that can be made, the idea of sharing their information with ease becomes more appealing and they are less likely to stop it being re-used. With the benefits of integrating themselves in the open data community and the tools available to make this into a reality, the gold mine is no longer off limits and data owners are lining up.</p>\n\n<p>From pulling in food prices on supermarket sites to monitor global food trends to quantifying public opinion from unstructured blog posts, opening up data is changing the way in which we view and think about the world. Combining innovative technology and advocacy has the capacity to bring an \u2018open data culture\u2019 to the forefront of the World Wide Web, and is something both Import.io and the ODI are committed to achieving.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Bea Schofield","slug":"bea-schofield","web_url":"http://theodi.org/bea-schofield","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Bea Schofield","slug":"bea-schofield","web_url":"http://theodi.org/bea-schofield","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/japan-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/japan-open-data","slug":"japan-open-data","title":"Member blog: Japan\u2019s growing open data movement  ","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:46+01:00","created_at":"2014-01-15T11:40:45+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"Open data has become one of the central topics of IT policy in Japan.

The Japanese government aims to achieve the world\u2019s best standard in terms of data provision by 2015.</p>\n\n<p>However, the importance of open data had been recognised even before the adoption of the government strategy. The Great East Japan earthquake of March 2011 reminded people of the importance of being able to join up re-useable data. Some pragmatic actions were taken to mitigate the aftermath by using available data. These included:</p>\n\n<p>\u25cf Probe data from car navigation systems which was mashed up on the GIS to identify routes that were still accessible.</p>\n\n<p>\u25cf Data on real time electricity shortages which was visualised on various websites and digital signage to encourage energy savings.</p>\n\n<p>The earthquake also deepened the interest of civil engineers in addressing social issues, for instance through:</p>\n\n<p>\u25cf The<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.sinsai.info/\"> sinsai.info</a> website where people could enter information on the 2011 earthquake for others to use.</p>\n\n<p>\u25cf <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/hackforjapan/\"> Hack for Japan</a>, a developer community that was started immediately after the earthquake as developers wished to use their technical skills to support the response to the disaster, and the subsequent recovery.</p>\n\n<p>These experiences made the advantages of using open data more compelling, not only for IT experts but also for policy makers.</p>\n\n<p>From a government agency perspective, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has been operating the<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://datameti.go.jp/\"> Open Data METI</a> portal site since 2012. The<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opendata.gr.jp/\"> Open Data Promotion Consortium</a> was established by various stakeholders including government agencies, local governments, private firms and experts. Among local governments,<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://linkdata.org/work/rdf1s127i\"> 19 cities</a> are promoting an open data programme.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://okfn.jp/\"> Open Knowledge Foundation Japan</a> (OKFJ) is a private sector community which is now playing a central role in promoting open data policy by linking together experts, policy makers and engineers.<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://code4japan.org/\"> Code for Japan</a> has built a community of more than 800 civic engineers with the purpose of solving social issues through the use of technology.</p>\n\n<p>However, use of open data is still in its infancy. As seen in many other countries, a number of events such as ideathons, hackathons and competitions have been organised throughout Japan. One of these, the<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://lod.sfc.keio.ac.jp/challenge2013/index.html\"> LOD challenge</a>, formed in 2011, is an annual contest using datasets, applications and ideas specifically focused on linked open data. In 2012, as a part of a worldwide initiative, OKFJ organised<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://odhd13.okfn.jp/\"> International Open Data Day in Japan</a> which attracted more than 300 participants across eight cities. &ldquo;Where does my money go?&rdquo;, originally developed by the Open Knowledge Foundation in UK, has been adopted by more than<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://spending.jp/\"> 60 cities</a> in Japan.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nttdata.com/global/en/\">NTT DATA</a> has played an important role within the open data movement by providing best practice case studies from around the world and making policy recommendations. Currently, as a supplier to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, NTT DATA is conducting a pilot project on the interoperability of open data with Sabae city and Yokohama city. By building a standard for data formats and APIs, a single application will be usable across different cities. NTT DATA in Japan is also organising an<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nttdata.com/jp/ja/news/information/2013/2013092501.html\"> open innovation forum</a> to connect entrepreneurs and large firms in focusing on the generation of business opportunities which exploit open data.</p>\n\n<p>On 9 December 2013, Richard Stirling of the Open Data Institute (ODI) and I participated in a<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://icpc.gr.jp/wordpress/?p=444\"> panel session</a> in Japan which covered a wide range of issues including the importance of open data both for addressing social issues and for creating new businesses. Mr Stirling also delivered a keynote speech at the Open Data Promotion Consortium<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opendata.gr.jp/2nd_symposium/en/index.html\"> conference</a> and inspired government executives and opinion leaders on the measures being taken by the ODI to boost business creation.</p>\n\n<p>After a period of research and a focus on increasing the availability of open data, Japan is ready to promote open data reuse to cultivate innovation. Japanese society continues to find new ways of deriving benefits from open data, exploiting both its own resources and experience from around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Soichiro Takagi, is a Deputy Manager on e-government research at NTT DATA Corporation</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"Helen Desmond","media_enquiries_email":"helen.desmond@theodi.org","media_enquiries_telephone":"07984 813831","alternative_title":"Open data has become one of the central topics of IT policy in Japan.","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Soichiro Takagi","slug":"soichiro-takagi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/soichiro-takagi","tag_ids":["members"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Soichiro Takagi","slug":"soichiro-takagi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/soichiro-takagi","tag_ids":["members"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/member-blog-risk-vs-opportunities-finding-balance-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/member-blog-risk-vs-opportunities-finding-balance-data","slug":"member-blog-risk-vs-opportunities-finding-balance-data","title":"Member blog: Risk vs Opportunities: finding the balance in data  ","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:01+01:00","created_at":"2013-08-31T11:42:41+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"Trust is one of the biggest issues when we speak about data.

To enable this dialogue we must talk more about ends and less about means, identify the value exchange and understand the expectations of everyone involved.</p>\n\n<p>So to start off, companies must be more open about their data. It\u2019s good for their business, they get innovation, learn new ways to become more efficient in their core activities. They give something back to society and have a shot at truly engaging consumers.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we must educate people on the different types of data and what can they be used for. Because sometimes you don\u2019t know what will come out of a project, there must be a flexible and secure framework to define what\u2019s allowed and what\u2019s not \u2013 and who gets to say that!</p>\n\n<p>Third, there are so many examples of how data is being used to the benefit of society \u0002\u2013 open or not \u2013 and how it impacts everyday life, that we don\u2019t really have to convince businesses, people and governments of how data can change the way we live. Let\u2019s go through a few of them:</p>\n\n<p>\u0002\n<strong>Social example \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cellcity2012.org/isabelleDanielle.html\">Cellcity 2012</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Understanding what the best tourist sites really are through an analysis of the people visiting at any given time. How much could tourism benefit from this? How much would emergency services gain in efficiency if they could prepare for the kinds of situations that might occur? And how much could you improve urban planning by having access to this information?</p>\n\n<p>\u0002\n<strong>Mobility example \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jetsetme.com/visualisation.html\">Jetsetme</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Understanding UK citizens\u2019 favorite travel destinations and their habits as tourists. This is a simple visualization with an easy to use API those who want to have a go at innovation. These insights could help people plan holidays and travel agencies to taylor their offerings.</p>\n\n<p>\u0002\n<strong>Health example \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://enriquefrias-martinez.info/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/SimulationEpidemicSpread.10893754.pdf\">Simulation of epidemic spread</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Using behavioral data to track how an epidemic spreads and helping governments and health organisations take steps to slow the propagation. This could enable managers to close down key contagion locations, reduce propagation and delay the peak of the epidemic.</p>\n\n<p>\u0002\nThese are only three examples.

Our Chef server then picks it up and deploys the code to production. No humans are involved in the process. It&rsquo;s robots all the way down.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve recently been experimenting with using <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\">Travis-CI</a> to run our tests, and wanted to know if we could do the same thing using Travis.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out we can, but it involves a certain amount of hoop-jumping. Presuming you&rsquo;ve got your project currently building in Travis, the steps are:</p>\n\n<p>Encrypt your Github login (from inside your local repo):</p>\n\n<pre><code>travis login\ntravis encrypt GITHUB_USER=odi-robot\ntravis encrypt GITHUB_PASSWORD=thisisareallyreallylonggithubpassword\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will give you a couple of strings, which you need to paste into your <em>.travis.yml</em> to make it look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>---\nafter_success:\n  - \"[ \\\"$TRAVIS_BRANCH\\\" == \\\"master\\\" ] &amp;&amp; curl -v -X DELETE -u $GITHUB_USER:$GITHUB_PASSWORD \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/$TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG/git/refs/tags/CURRENT\\\"\"\n  - \"[ \\\"$TRAVIS_BRANCH\\\" == \\\"master\\\" ] &amp;&amp; curl -v -X POST -d '{\\\"ref\\\":\\\"refs/tags/CURRENT\\\",\\\"sha\\\":\\\"'$TRAVIS_COMMIT'\\\"}' --header \\\"Content-Type:application/json\\\" -u $GITHUB_USER:$GITHUB_PASSWORD \\\"https://api.github.com/repos/$TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG/git/refs\\\"\"\nenv:\n  global:\n    -\n      secure: longuglyencryptedstringnumber1=\n    -\n      secure: longuglyencryptedstringnumber2=\nlanguage: ruby\nrvm:\n  - \"2.0.0\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s probably best if you avert your gaze from those <em>after_success</em> lines, lest you be turned to stone. The real trick is interpolating that <em>$TRAVIS_COMMIT</em> into the single-quoted JSON payload. If there&rsquo;s a less-hideous way of doing this, I&rsquo;d really like to hear about it.</p>\n\n<p>In the course of debugging this (which took <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travis-ci.org/theodi/such-travis/builds\">way longer than it should have</a>), I was pointed towards the brilliant <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://requestb.in/\">requestb.in</a> HTTP-request-inspection tool (thanks <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith\">James</a>), without which I may have simply thrown in the towel.

We want to give confidence to people to invest their time, energy, and money: to build sustainable services that meet user needs, and improve people\u2019s lives.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>\u2018Given the level of interest we have seen, we anticipate wide global adoption of Open Data Certificates.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>The certificate is made up of two components:</p>\n\n<p>1)\u0002a visual mark that shows the quality level of the data</p>\n\n<p>2) a human and machine-readable description of the data being released</p>\n\n<p>There are four levels of certificates:</p>\n\n<p>Raw: A great start at the basics of publishing open data.</p>\n\n<p>Pilot: Data users receive extra support from, and provide feedback to the publisher.</p>\n\n<p>Standard: Regularly published open data with robust support that people can rely on.</p>\n\n<p>Expert: An exceptional example of information infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits of the certificates include helping:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>publishers of data understand how they can better connect with their users;</li>\n  <li>users of data to understand its quality, licensing, structure, and its usability;</li>\n  <li>businesses, entrepreneurs and innovators have confidence that the data has value to them;</li>\n  <li>policy-makers benchmark and compare the progress and quality of the data released.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Commercial and public sector organisations have already committed to the certificates including:<br />\n - Open Corporates: corporate information for over 50 million companies worldwide</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>OpenStreetMap: the free wiki world map offering worldwide open geodata</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>-\u0002legislation.gov.uk: 500 years of UK legislation information</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>amee: an environmental score for each of the 2.7 million companies in Britain</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>MastodonC:\u0002energy monitoring data analysis from Retrofit for the Future projects</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Placr: transport data covering all 360,000 stops and stations nationwide</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Jeni Tennison, Technical Director at the ODI\u0002said:</p>\n\n<p>\u2018Publishing open data can be difficult, time-consuming and may need the support of legal and technical teams.

The challenge approach means \u0002that we are seeing ideas that are unique, innovative and most\u0002 importantly, bringing positive\u0002 benefits to peoples\u2019 daily lives.\u0002 These aren\u2019t pie in the sky concepts but practical uses of open \u0002data which could deliver huge social and economic value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Open Data Challenge Series is a two-year programme run by the \u0002ODI and Nesta and funded by BIS to solve social challenges using\u0002 open data resources. It encourages individuals and organisations to \u0002work with data providers, industry experts and business leaders to\u0002 develop ways of using open data sets to create new business\u0002 opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>The collaboration between the Open Data Institute and Nesta, will \u0002continue with six further series including Energy and the \u0002Environment, and Personal Data. The next Creation and Innovation\u0002 weekends will take place in January 2014.\u0002 For\u0002 more information the \u0002<a href=\"/challenge-series\">Open Data Challenge Series webpage</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Audio interviews with all seven teams can be found <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/theodi/sets/odcs_crime\">here:</a></strong></p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/12241173\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/new-open-data-powered-platform-for-community-energy-groups.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/new-open-data-powered-platform-for-community-energy-groups","slug":"new-open-data-powered-platform-for-community-energy-groups","title":"New open data powered platform for community energy groups","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:45:00+01:00","created_at":"2014-07-04T11:21:04+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/opendatachallengeseries","slug":"opendatachallengeseries","title":"Open Data Challenge Series","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:38+01:00","created_at":"2012-12-13T09:45:46+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"Today we are pleased to announce the winner of our Energy and Environment Open Data Challenge as **Community Energy Manager, **a service for community energy groups developed by Matthew Wood and Mark Corbin.

The solution came into its own as a product of the Energy and Environment <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oce9DGFRTJo&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Open Data Challenge</a> run in partnership by the Open Data Institute and Nesta. In this challenge, participants were invited to develop a product or solution using open data that supports communities to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>group buy their energy and save money;</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>undertake community based energy efficiency interventions; or</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>start to generate their own energy.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Matt and Mark drew on their own deep understanding of the community energy market and on user research (provided as part of the challenge process) to identify the problem that CEM seeks to address. In essence, they are working to address the barriers that individual householders face when taking advantage of the energy saving interventions available through the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) and the Green Deal (GD), as well as organise bulk purchasing initiatives. Incentives and ambition to overcome these challenges exist across the sector - for example, the recent Community Energy Strategy from the Department of Energy and Climate Change highlighted the Government\u2019s desire to support communities to come together and undertake energy saving interventions, such as external wall insulation. CEM will aggregate these savings and initiatives and enable individuals and communities to select those interventions that are best suited to their situation.</p>\n\n<p>When it is up and running, the service will invite community groups to log their interactions with householders (e.g. surveys, home audits) on CEM and utilise that information to identify key projects they can undertake, for example if 500 people need a new boiler. Through the brokerage service, GD providers and installers will offer referral fees for these &ldquo;warm leads&rdquo;, which will provide a revenue stream for community groups. Similarly, if a group wants to launch a share offer for renewable energy investment or organise a bulk purchase of insulation materials, CEM can help facilitate this.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/b6/83/53b6839ef362be294500006d/image_0_1.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"attachment-53b6839e1f986a518b000004\" /></p>\n\n<p>CEM uses open data from the Census and DECC as well as information from Local Authorities to power the service. These open data sources are central to the service as it allows groups to highlight particular areas which have a specific need, so they can support the most vulnerable householders.</p>\n\n<p>After being selected by our judging panel as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/get-know-finalists-energy-environment-open-data-challenge\">one of three finalists</a> to receive \u00a35,000 and additional incubation support over the last two months, CEM was chosen as the overall winner to receive \u00a340,000 equity-free seed funding.

We still hadn\u2019t finished working out <strong>this</strong> ODI, and everyone we spoke to had a different idea about what an Open Data Institute might do. </p>\n\n<p>ODI is non-profit. Non-partisan. We responded to these requests by creating an open process, and an open conversation. </p>\n\n<p>In a remarkably short period of time (4 months), we went from some ideas, to documents, to signed agreements with 13 organisations around the world. </p>\n\n<p>I have spoken to well over 100 people, from dozens of groups, from over 30 countries. By email, by video Skype (with up to 4 organisations/countries at a time), and in person. It\u2019s the beginning of a voyage.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d like to share some of the things we\u2019ve learned over the last 16 weeks. </p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>There is huge positive intent almost everywhere: a willingness to try.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>You can build quickly. </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>There are consequences of doing so. There is confusion. </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Lack of understanding had led to some distrust. </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>How we follow-through will be critical.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ukodi/10614707453/\" title=\"ODI Annual Summit: 2013 by OpenDataInstitute, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/10614707453_21dea8468f_c.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"\" alt=\"ODI Annual Summit: 2013\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Before we started, we looked at a lot of different models, from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res to Human Rights Watch, from Github to Ushahidi. I combined this with my personal experience of creating organisations (ODI is the 9th company I\u2019ve helped to build over the last 20 years), with insights from our team, and many others. </p>\n\n<p>The ODI is new, it\u2019s well-funded, has unique founders and an amazing team. This is a privilege, and with such privilege comes a responsibility. I made a decision that it was our responsibility to experiment in the creation of a global open organisation. I didn\u2019t want to over-think this, I felt we would learn more by trying it. The ODI board, and the team, agreed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. \u2014 <em>proverb</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We made a choice, an active choice, to go fast. We chose to run with people and organisations that could wonder, and run, with us at a pace.  </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been blown away by the number of people willing to commit their time and energy to collaboration. People I\u2019ve never met have worked together, with obvious positive intent, built trust with us (we don\u2019t know everyone), trusted us (ODI is the new kid on the block, after all), and looked to a future where a global network might be able to make a difference. </p>\n\n<p>We are definitely not alone, but we (the whole open data community) are also not together. That we have any Nodes at all is a better outcome than I was expecting: the worst would have been that no one noticed. </p>\n\n<p>Our choice was to create a lightweight, fail-fast, &ldquo;many-parts loosely-joined&rdquo; network \u2014 to see what was possible. To \u201cshake the tree&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don&rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A natural and considered consequence of this was, and is, that we won&rsquo;t get it right. But, as we do with all our projects, it\u2019s better to start development, test it, fix it, iterate\u2026 my operating principle was \u2014 and still is \u2014 &ldquo;code-test-fix-repeat&rdquo;, in an open environment. </p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://github.com/theodi/ODI\">http://github.com/theodi/ODI</a> is where that happens. </p>\n\n<h3>People are (always) a lot harder than code</h3>\n\n<p>I set up a mailing list. I added over 50 people who had explicitly asked to join in the conversation. Very few people used it. I think (but don\u2019t know) that many were interested in what might be being said, but very few were willing to put their own hand up (maybe they didn\u2019t feel empowered). So, after trying to stimulate conversation this way, I stopped. </p>\n\n<p>Instead I put out a call for &ldquo;open discussion sessions&rdquo;: time slots where I would be available on a video Skype or Google Hangout for anyone from the group to join, and discuss what we all might want to do. We set them up for 8am, 5pm, 10pm, to cover all the time-zones. I turned up. Almost no one else did. So we stopped trying that. </p>\n\n<p>We then went for the labour-intensive route. My (exceptional) assistant, Jade, contacted people individually to set up small, dedicated calls for me with 3-4 people from different organisations or countries. We did over 20 of these in 2 weeks. During each call I made an open Google Doc for everyone on the call to see my notes, and their notes, about the call. </p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, we had progress. Fast progress. People edited the proto-contracts during the calls. Everyone, collectively, came up with the names of the Nodes: Country, City/Region, Communications (initially I called them level 1, 2, 3). People asked lots of questions. Then we all answered them. </p>\n\n<p>The single most powerful component of the process was this (on first calls with new people):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>me: &ldquo;here is the draft contract we\u2019ve created&rdquo;<br />\nthem: &ldquo;we don\u2019t understand how X might work&rdquo; [slightly apprehensive about ODI\u2019s intent]<br />\nme: &ldquo;neither do I, could you edit it with what you think?&rdquo;<br />\nthem: &ldquo;oh!&rdquo; <em>they edit in changes to the contract</em> [trust built, this is now a collaboration]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can\u2019t overstate how often this repeated and how much it broke the ice on a new relationship. Quickly the questions turned into patterns, and everyone became &ldquo;comfortable enough&rdquo; with the intent, the deliverables, and the financial model. </p>\n\n<p>For me, it was quite a &ldquo;high density&rdquo; data and communications process. I think there was only one time I introduced someone to the person who\u2019d introduced them to me in the first place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ukodi/10592072793/\" title=\"Open Data Institute Annual Summit 2013 by OpenDataInstitute, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5504/10592072793_1b00af6407_c.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"\" alt=\"Open Data Institute Annual Summit 2013\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>Outcomes</h3>\n\n<p>In the 2 weeks leading up to the first ODI Summit, 13 organisations from around the world, signed a contract to become an ODI Node. Their commitment: time, energy, and money. Our commitment: time, energy, and money. More on the money later&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>The ODI provides training, research and development, and incubates startups. It bridges between commercial, public sector, research and third sector communities. </p>\n\n<p>Nodes are attached to existing organisations (for-profit, non-profit, or academic), and not to individuals, in-part to reflect the ODI\u2019s commercial focus.  </p>\n\n<p>The focus for our Node conversations were to</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Support a community.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Bring a project to collaborate on.  </p>\n\n    <p>(or, if you are a Communications Node, bring stories and use-cases)</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Key themes are around amplifying what is there, growing the reach of open data \u2014 <strong>for everyone</strong>. </p>\n\n<h3>The risk</h3>\n\n<p>The board, rightly, asked me a very important question.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We\u2019re a new organisation. You don\u2019t know what these Nodes might do, we don\u2019t have much/any control. Why would you put our hard-won brand at such risk with this idea?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My answer was</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is a risk. But what is the risk if we don\u2019t do it? What is the opportunity? The worst-case is we pick the wrong organisation to be a Node, or they do something damaging. If they do, they stop being a Node. This is why we have an ODI Charter, a licensed brand, and a central registry. It\u2019s certain we won\u2019t be able to have certainty, and we\u2019ll make mistakes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And, certainly, we will.</p>\n\n<p>Even before the Nodes idea, we heard that some felt confused or even threatened by ODI. Since, I\u2019ve heard comments ranging from </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ODI, are they friend or foe? <em>to</em> They ignored existing open data community X in Y <em>to</em> We\u2019ve been doing this for X years. Who do they think they are?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We recognise that there are lots of people already working in the space, and doing great things. We want to add to those activities, not take away from them. We are coming to this with positive intent. We are working it out as we go along, and have to be able to make mistakes rather than being frozen into inactivity for fear of doing the wrong thing.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>We are working to build a new organisation, called the Open Data Institute. </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>ODI\u2019s mission is to help <strong>catalyse the evolution of open data culture</strong>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>We\u2019ve done almost everything completely in the open.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>We don\u2019t know everything, or know everyone, and we never can.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Everyone is limited in time, energy, and money.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>We\u2019re all, every one of us, working it out.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If people are asking about what the ODI does, please share this page, or our first <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odis-first-year-annual-report\">Annual Report</a>. Please ask if you\u2019d like hard-copies to share (they are lovely things). If you know anyone we should be reaching out to, please let me know (my email is <a href=\"&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#103;&#097;&#118;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#111;&#100;&#105;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;\">&#103;&#097;&#118;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#111;&#100;&#105;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>).</p>\n\n<h3>About the money</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Money is like a sixth sense without which you cannot make a complete use of the other five. \u2014 <em>Maugham</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I strongly believe that part of the ODI\u2019s responsibility is to increase the amount of money to the whole the open data landscape. </p>\n\n<p>I have been reminded, almost daily, of the 1990s. Huge numbers of talented, passionate people built the open web, often unpaid, and the foundations of where we all are today. Then, as the money flowed in, different sets of people benefited. Often the volunteers, the innovators, who made amazing things, stayed unpaid or worse, unrecognised, for their works. There are many stories on those mountains.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t want to see this happen again, but I see it coming in the open data landscape. McKinsey said only 2 weeks ago that open data would be worth up to $5 <strong>trillion</strong> a year. I\u2019m concerned that the same things will happen again as in the 90s. We want to help do things differently this time.</p>\n\n<p>Tim and Nigel\u2019s vision was that the ODI should catalyse the <strong>demand-side</strong> of open data. If there isn\u2019t demand, then there\u2019s no need for the supply \u2014 that\u2019s a big risk. </p>\n\n<p>My job is to help ODI make that demand-side work. For me, to make it work, everyone\u2019s work needs to be operationally sustainable, which means people need to be paid, properly. A lot more money has to flow towards open data people, and open data places.</p>\n\n<p>We have already demonstrated that it is possible to bring in new money: over $1m of commercial income from ODI Members in 6 months, over $3m of prize funds, over $20m of development funding. These are big numbers with one lens, and tiny numbers when we look at the scale of what\u2019s needed.  </p>\n\n<p>How do we get a million people involved in making a difference (social, economic, and environmental) using open data? How do we help bring 0.1% ($1bn) of that McKinsey figure to making that difference?</p>\n\n<h3>ODI charges Nodes</h3>\n\n<p>To instil this commercial focus in the Node models, we have borrowed from franchise-like models. ODI licenses its brand. For small companies this is a &ldquo;nominal amount&rdquo;, \u00a350. I picked a number (it could have been \u00a31) so we could raise an invoice. Raising an invoice and getting paid tests a lot about processes, and cements our contracts. The fee is more for big organisations.</p>\n\n<p>For material work, we have put an initial stake in the ground of 10% of Node-related revenue (with the ability to exempt certain work). For example, some Nodes want to provide paid-for training, and are happy passing 10% back to us. Some will get local grants which 10% can\u2019t be shared from. This is fine. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know if 10% is the right number, but I do want to create an economic flow. If we get this right, I believe we can do three critical things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>we can help co-fund projects across the network</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>we can help fundraise both centrally to support projects, and support local/distributed fundraising</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>we can communicate the economic growth of the open data community, which is crucial to points 1 and 2</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ukodi/10590295824/\" title=\"Open Data Institute Annual Summit 2013 by OpenDataInstitute, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3784/10590295824_b0cddc8239_c.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"\" alt=\"Open Data Institute Annual Summit 2013\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>What next</h3>\n\n<p>I thought we might, with a favourable wind, have 4 or 5 Nodes by the Summit. We have 13 in 9 countries, and this is set to grow very soon. </p>\n\n<p>Our next step is to talk, with each other, with you. We now have time to put in some code (e.g. what project will someone deliver), some tests (e.g. did it have any impact), processes (e.g. how well was communication managed), and iterate (e.g. adding metrics). The commitment we\u2019re making is to iterate.</p>\n\n<p>ODI has run, quickly, to establish the beginnings of a global presence. The cadence we have inside the UK ODI is to move quickly, then take time to listen and reflect on concrete evidence, test, and iterate. This is our mode of development. </p>\n\n<p>Questions we\u2019ll address include accrediting trainers, syndicating membership, and using open data certificates. We will share our knowledge, showcase the work of the Nodes and the whole community, and work out how the global network can coordinate on issues, resources, and funding. </p>\n\n<p>We want to solve problems. Our mission statement is, I hope, really clear: &ldquo;catalyse the evolution of open data culture&rdquo;. This, is for everyone.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Gavin Starks","slug":"gavin-starks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks","tag_ids":["board","executive","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Gavin Starks","slug":"gavin-starks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks","tag_ids":["board","executive","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014","slug":"odi-node-knowledge-feb-2014","title":"Node knowledge - Feb 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:38+01:00","created_at":"2014-02-22T21:35:57+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/from-seoul-to-osaka-asia-pacific-opens-arms-to-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/from-seoul-to-osaka-asia-pacific-opens-arms-to-open-data","slug":"from-seoul-to-osaka-asia-pacific-opens-arms-to-open-data","title":"From Seoul to Osaka - Asia Pacific opens arms to open data as ODI announces five new international Nodes","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:33+01:00","created_at":"2014-02-17T11:39:20+00:00","tag_ids":["news"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Today (Sat Feb 22nd 2014), people around the world are celebrating the 4th annual Open Data Day.

Tomorrow, I leave for Washington DC, where I will be encouraging new partners to join the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odp4d\">Partnership for Open Data</a> to help support open data in developing economies. At the start of this week, we held our first Node gathering. Further to my <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/node-knowledge-november-2013\">November Node update</a>, I wanted to reflect on our progress, and on what the year ahead holds for open data.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, we convened 12 ODI Nodes from 9 countries in London for two days of shared learning, knowledge exchange, and action planning, as we develop our collaborative global network.</p>\n\n<p>We discussed our positioning, how and which communities can come together, which specific training, research, and projects (e.g. the ongoing internationalisation of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificates</a>) can best utilise the power of the network, and how to scale quality delivery. The recurring themes: of openness and networks, will provide organisational power and be the instrument for change.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the 2 days, collaborations were already forming, funding opportunities had been discussed, and planning was initiated, covering business models, communication, projects, and people. These reflect the ongoing commercially-focussed approach that the ODI in the UK has taken.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>\u201cWho knew data could be so interesting?\u201d</strong> - ODI Training attendee</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For example, our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/courses\">training programme</a> has proved invaluable to politicians, policy-makers, lawyers, journalists, and developers alike. We learned that there is a global need, and one of the actions for the group is to work out a scalable syndication model for ODI Training. </p>\n\n<p>This will address issues such as:\nthe scope and range of courses\ntarget markets (e.g. public sector, NGOs, private sector);\nprocesses for localisation (both in language and in content);\nhow to scale delivery  (e.g. identifying trainers);\nhow to maintain quality; and\nwhat online training might involve</p>\n\n<p>As we align our ambitions, actions, and systems, we will make our ongoing work more visible using open data, and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dashboards.theodi.org/company/2013\">ODI Dashboards</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Node reach is expanding, in concert with other great international progress</strong></p>\n\n<p>We also <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/news/from-seoul-to-osaka-asia-pacific-opens-arms-to-open-data\">announced five new ODI Nodes</a>, including our first two Nodes in the Asia-Pacific region: Seoul (South Korea), Osaka (Japan), Philadelphia (USA), Hawaii (USA) and Sheffield (UK). This weekend ODI Osaka will be joining up six cities across Japan (Osaka, Kyoto, Tanba, Tokushima, Yokohama, and Tokyo) to begin planning with the UK team.</p>\n\n<p>Momentum continues to build around open data movement: the Canadian Government has announced <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.einnews.com/pr_news/191779248/canada-publishes-its-g8-open-data-action-plan-for-international-open-data-day\">$3m support</a> for the Open Data Institute in Canada. We are also working with the World Bank and Open Knowledge Foundation to bring <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odp4d\">the power of open data to developing economies</a>. This year we will rolling out our training and support to a number of countries. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Smart cities are one area of common interest</strong></p>\n\n<p>Part of our focus this year will be on smart cities. Our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/research\">UK research</a> team are already working on this area. This will combine with ODI Partners including Arup and Telefonica, startups like CarbonCulture and DemandLogic, and Nodes in Chicago, Manchester, and Seoul. We expect to build tangible evidence in this area through our networks.  As a member of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/business-economy/vision-and-strategy/smart-london/smart-london-board\">Smart London Board</a>, I highlight the essential role of open data in tackling the challenges faced by London and all cities: how to scale with limited resource (London expects to grow by 1m people over the next 10 years). In December we launched the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/smart_london_plan.pdf\">Smart London Plan</a>, setting out how digital expertise and technology can improve the lives of Londoners. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t believe we can scale society without open data. Open data will also enable smart cities to network with each other, to learn and adapt.</p>\n\n<p>Surfacing and communicating evidence-based stories that are meaningful to people\u2019s daily lives remains central to the outputs of the ODI. This includes reaching new audiences, supporting existing communities, and growing an open network that reflects open data culture.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Gavin Starks","slug":"gavin-starks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks","tag_ids":["board","executive","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Gavin Starks","slug":"gavin-starks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks","tag_ids":["board","executive","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-ceo-joins-mayor-s-smart-london-board.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-ceo-joins-mayor-s-smart-london-board","slug":"odi-ceo-joins-mayor-s-smart-london-board","title":"ODI CEO joins Mayor\u2019s \"Smart London\" board","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:30+01:00","created_at":"2013-03-04T13:48:48+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"Gavin Starks has joined a line-up of experts including leading academics, businesses and entrepreneurs to develop a \u2018Smart London\u2019 vision that puts technological innovation at the heart of making the capital a better place to live, work and invest.

Read on to find out why we choose these topics, and about our other plans for the year.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for research to be seen as an optional extra &ndash; a &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; to be invested in when times are good, and scaled back when finances are stretched. An alternative perspective says invest in research during a downturn, thereby ensuring you have rewards to reap when economics improve.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective as Head of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/research\">Research</a> at the ODI I see things differently. The ODI is a non-profit with a mission to support the success of others through open data, and therefore ODI research should serve a sustaining function for the community as a whole. Understanding and addressing open challenges in open data should be our core business.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s this perspective that&rsquo;s driving our research agenda in 2014. Strictly-speaking, open data has been around for aeons, at least when you live at Web speed it has, but awareness is only now spilling over into the mainstream. With this, the ODI and open data in general have been enjoying an incredible honeymoon period. There have been many macro-economic studies that demonstrate the value of open data, but we need to supplement these with more detailed evidence that helps governments and other organisations make decisions about their open data strategies.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, the first of our two highest priorities for ODI research in 2014 is in building this evidence base. Some of it exists already, in case studies, research reports, academic papers, and anecdotes from those at the vanguard of open data. This is a great start, but we need to be much more systematic in collating this evidence, and more comprehensive &ndash; not least to help feed the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/courses\">ODI training programme</a> with compelling examples of open data impact. We also, as the evidence base matures, will need to set higher standards for ourselves in terms of depth and rigour. A diversity of styles of evidence will always be important, as each will speak to different audiences, but we need to be confident that at the core is a research base of the highest scholarly standards.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not for the ODI to be the sole developer of this evidence base &ndash; far from it. There are many stakeholders who are already actively contributing, and we hope that number will grow significantly. Where I believe the ODI can bring greatest value is in acting as a convenor and a focal point for this evidence base, and this will be our initial emphasis.</p>\n\n<p>The other top priority of 2014 also speaks directly to the theme of sustaining &ndash; in this case of the momentum and energy of those working with open data. One of the most persistent questions posed by potential consumers is &ldquo;where can I find the data?&rdquo;. As yet there&rsquo;s no credible answer to this question. A common response is to list a number of places to start looking, often followed by a list of caveats offered in the name of expectation management. This situation is neither acceptable or sustainable, on practical or credibility grounds, if open data is to continue its current trajectory. </p>\n\n<p>To begin addressing this, we are collaborating with one of our commercial partners to develop a substantial research project exploring methods for open data discovery that will scale to massive numbers of data sets distributed across massive numbers of internet domains. We anticipate a range of applications of the research outcomes, not least the potential to support smart cities by tying together the vast and heterogeneous data resources generated in and relevant to a particular urban area.</p>\n\n<p>As we explore this research direction, our FP7 research projects <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatamonitor.eu/\">OpenDataMonitor</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dapaas.eu/\">DaPaaS</a> will continue to provide inspiration and insight regarding, respectively, how open data deployment is evolving, and how the needs of open data publishers and consumers can best be met. ODI tools and services, such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificates</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/\">CSVLint</a>, will also provide frameworks against which we can assess how data is being published and where there are opportunities for improvement.</p>\n\n<p>With those priorities on our agenda it&rsquo;s going to a busy year for the ODI research team, but we also have our sights set on issues even closer to home. With the ODI in its second full year of operations, now is the time to review the metrics we use to measure our own success. Just as we&rsquo;ll be researching the evidence of open data impacts more broadly, we&rsquo;ll also be getting more rigorous and systematic about measuring the impacts of the ODI itself, be they economic, social or environmental. Naturally we&rsquo;ll do everything we can in the open.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[{"name":"Open Data Institute (ODI)","slug":"odi-open-data-institute","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi-open-data-institute"}],"author":{"name":"Tom Heath","slug":"tom-heath","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/tom-heath","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Tom Heath","slug":"tom-heath","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/tom-heath","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[{"name":"Open Data Institute (ODI)","slug":"odi-open-data-institute","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi-open-data-institute"}],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-responds-postcode-data-consultation.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-responds-postcode-data-consultation","slug":"odi-responds-postcode-data-consultation","title":"ODI Responds to Postcode Data Consultation","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:07+01:00","created_at":"2012-10-26T16:59:38+01:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"*The ODI has responded to a consultation on the licensing terms for Postcode Data (PAF) with a strong message that Royal Mail should not spend further money on developing restrictive licensing and pricing options for the reuse of PAF\u00ae data. *  ","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p>*The ODI has responded to a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.pafboard.org.uk/documents/PAF%2812%2929%20LICENCE%20CONSULTATION%20SEPTEMBER%202012.pdf\">consultation on the licensing terms for Postcode Data (PAF)</a> with a strong message that Royal Mail \u0002should not spend further money on developing restrictive licensing and pricing options for the reuse of PAF\u00ae data. *  </p>\n\n<p>In its response, the Institute argues that restrictive practices limit the potential economic and social value that opening the data could unlock and argues that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Postcode Address File (PAF), owned by the Royal Mail, should be made available as open data</li>\n  <li>freeing up this data would benefit new and existing businesses in the UK</li>\n  <li>Royal Mail could support the maintenance of PAF by partnering with other organisations that gain value from using it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The ODI\u2019s Technical Director, Jeni Tennison said:  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cToday we are publishing our response to the Possible PAF Licence Revision Consultation because even though the ODI has yet to launch officially, we think the opportunity to open up PAF data is too significant to ignore.

Please feel free to publish this response; we are also publishing it on our own website.  </p>\n\n<p>The Open Data Institute is a new not-for-profit centre for innovation which aims to maximise the social, environmental and economic value of open data. We have \u00a310m funding over the next five years from the Technology Strategy Board, part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which we will at least match through funding from commercial organisations. As well as raising open data capability in government and enterprise, we seek to support new, innovative start-ups that take advantage of open data in their products and services.  </p>\n\n<p>We are responding to the PAF\u00ae licence consultation because the PAF\u00ae is both a key resource for direct use by existing and new businesses and a vital component of many other datasets that, were it not for the restrictive licensing of PAF\u00ae, could be released as open data. As such, changes to the licensing terms and pricing of PAF\u00ae have impacts far beyond its existing customer base.  </p>\n\n<p>There is a real opportunity for the PAF\u00ae Advisory Board to create economic and social value by radically changing the way in which Royal Mail manages this asset, which is vital not only to Royal Mail but to the country as a whole. We would challenge you to take up this opportunity and press for Royal Mail to release PAF\u00ae as open data and we would like to meet with the PAF\u00ae Advisory Board, or a relevant working group, to discuss this response.  </p>\n\n<p>Yours faithfully,  </p>\n\n<p>Gavin Starks<br />\n CEO  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q1 In the interests of simplicity and of fairness do you favour significantly changing the terms and conditions for the supply of PAF\u00ae?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Yes. In the interests of both simplicity and fairness, we favour changing the terms and conditions for PAF\u00ae such that it is available as open data: made available for free and without restriction on how it is used.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q2 How should the costs of reliable and up-to-date PAF\u00ae data be shared?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>For the Royal Mail, maintaining a reliable and up-to-date PAF\u00ae is a necessary cost of doing business: Royal Mail could not deliver mail without it. Royal Mail should be enabled to recover those costs through charging those who wish to have mail delivered to their properties such as property developers who build new properties and demolish old ones, and both individuals and companies who wish to receive mail.  </p>\n\n<p>Royal Mail will also save money compared to their current approach by releasing PAF\u00ae as open data, as the simpler model of dissemination will be more straightforward technically and not require as many sales or legal staff to be employed by them.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q3 How might the pricing arrangements be developed to stimulate PAF\u00ae usage in the economy without adverse effects on data quality or the incentive to Royal Mail to develop PAF\u00ae data further?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Delivering PAF\u00ae free for commercial and non-commercial reuse will have positive direct and indirect effects on the economy as a whole. Firstly, it will enable new and existing businesses to take advantage of PAF\u00ae without the current financial and legal burdens they endure. Secondly, and more importantly, it means that data derived from information within PAF\u00ae will be freed for reuse, which will again stimulate new and old businesses to work more efficiently and effectively with address information.  </p>\n\n<p>The PAF\u00ae Advisory Board should not underestimate the enormous \u0002effect that the PAF\u00ae&rsquo;s restrictive licensing has on open-data availability within the UK as a whole. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.adresse-info.dk/Portals/2/Benefit/Value_Assessment_Danish_Address_Data_UK_2010-07-07b.pdf\">release of the Danish address data as open data</a> in has led to a return on investment of 31:1 for direct usage over the first four years (on a spend of \u20ac2m) and a return on investment of 70:1 on use in 2010 (on a spend of \u20ac0.2m). These figures do not factor in indirect benefits to the economy (from further reusers of the data), and they illustrate how maintenance costs have decreased over time.  </p>\n\n<p>With the additional use and importance of PAF\u00ae, Royal Mail should be able to find willing and trustworthy partners who will also care about developing PAF\u00ae and improving its data quality. Royal Mail could develop these partnerships to reduce Royal Mail&rsquo;s maintenance costs by shouldering some of those costs themselves.  </p>\n\n<p>As proof of this model, we encourage the PAF Board to look at the Expert Participation Programme being run from The National Archives which will bring the government&rsquo;s legislation database up to date \u2014 massively improving its data quality in a way that The National Archives cannot do on its own \u2014 with assistance from commercial companies, government departments, academic institutions and others. This model is predicated on the availability of legislation as open data, as partners know that their contributions will be freely accessible forever.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q4 Should Royal Mail continue to develop transactional pricing options and should there be a difference between the price for internal purposes (within the organisation) and external usage (through a public facing web site)?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Royal Mail should concentrate on:<br />\n \u0002\n- bringing down the cost of maintaining PAF\u00ae, through technical and process improvement\n- increasing its in-house capabilities on publishing open data\n- partnering with organisations that can contribute to PAF\u00ae\u2019s maintenance\n- developing charging models for updates to the database</p>\n\n<p>It should not spend money on developing restrictive licensing and pricing options for the reuse of PAF\u00ae data, which limit the potential economic and social value that opening the data could unlock.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q5 Do you wish to make any observations about the Government move to negotiate a centrally paid flat fee for non-commercial public sector use?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The public sector is one of many potential partners who rely upon PAF\u00ae to carry out their day-to-day work. The Royal Mail should cultivate this partnership to ensure that Government is able to effectively contribute to the maintenance of PAF\u00ae, supporting its release as open data.  </p>\n\n<p>If PAF\u00ae is not released as open data, the restrictions on the licensing of data derived from PAF\u00ae currently restrict Government&rsquo;s ability to effectively implement its Open Data policies. A flat fee for public sector use should include the ability for Government to publish data derived from PAF\u00ae as open data.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q6 How might these differences [in requirements regarding timeliness for reusers] be represented in the provision of PAF\u00ae without disproportionately complicating the licence conditions? Should the most frequent updating command a premium fee?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>From our experience, it seems likely that the easiest way of implementing open access to PAF\u00ae would be to provide direct access to the data as currently stored within the database through an API. Dumps of the entire database might also be provided on a daily or weekly basis, coupled with feeds of changes that enable others to keep their versions synchronised with that held by Royal Mail. All these types of access (API, dumps and feeds of changes) should be available as open data, with no fee associated with them.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q7 What frequency of updating would best suit your usage?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Most of our required uses of PAF\u00ae would be best satisfied through API access, which is most easily implemented through direct access to current data.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q8 What are your views on:<br />\n \u0002(a) Direct end-user licensing;<br />\n \u0002(b) Solutions Providers paying licence fees on behalf of their customers based on a simple banding of end users\u2019 potential use leaving PAF\u00ae free at the point of use;<br />\n \u0002(c) Unchanged arrangements?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>All these complex licensing options are the result of PAF\u00ae not being available as open data. When choosing between these options, Royal Mail should demonstrate how any of these options leads to a more efficient and effective dissemination and use of PAF\u00ae, and more economic benefit to the UK, than its release as open data.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q9 Which [licensing] approach do you favour?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Short, simple licences significantly reduce the barriers to reusing data, particularly by those organisations who cannot afford high legal costs. Open licences tend to be short and simple. We favour an open licence, such as the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/\">UK Open Government Licence</a>, which is two pages long.  </p>\n\n<p>We also observe that the complexity of the PAF\u00ae licence has a direct impact on the ability of those deriving data from PAF\u00ae to work out the limits on their onward licensing of that derived data, and thus has an adverse impact on much potential open data publication within the UK.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q10 Are there other ways in which the UK generic licence could be simplified?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>If PAF\u00ae is not released under an open licence, we recommend that Royal Mail join the Information Fair Trader Scheme, run by the Office of Public Sector Information within The National Archives, through which they can get advice about how to simplify their licence terms.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q11 How should the definition of a user (currently \u2018an individual work station or terminal or hand-held or otherwise portable device internal to the End-User\u2019) be amended in the light of technological developments?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>We have no response to this question, but observe that it illustrates the disproportionate effort that must be spent constructing licences that restrict access to, and usage of, PAF\u00ae. This effort would be better spent facilitating open access to PAF\u00ae.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q12 To what extent should potential disruption and extra costs of adjustment to new arrangements inhibit Royal Mail from making changes?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The impacts of even small changes to licensing conditions are disruptive because they require legal assistance to assess the impact on existing businesses. In contrast, the impacts of adopting an open licence are clear to all concerned, and although potentially disruptive to existing businesses, provide many opportunities for new businesses and thus for economic growth.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q13 Currently licensing arrangements have a 3 year minimum term with annual renewal. Does this meet your requirements or how should it be amended?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>We have no response to this question.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q14 If only minimal amendments were to be made to the existing licence what would be your priorities for change?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>We have no response to this question.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Q15 What suggestions do you wish to make to improve contact between the Board and the market for PAF\u00ae?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>We would recommend that the Board appoint a member from the start-up / SME community to represent potential reusers of PAF\u00ae who currently may not use it due to legal and financial barriers. We would welcome meeting with the Board to help them identify potential members in this group.  </p>\n\n<p>\u0002</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-startup-programme-intake-3.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-startup-programme-intake-3","slug":"odi-startup-programme-intake-3","title":"ODI Startup Programme: Intake #3","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:37+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-24T13:56:23+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/start-ups.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/start-ups","slug":"start-ups","title":"Start-ups","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:57+01:00","created_at":"2013-11-19T17:08:42+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/start-up-phase.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/start-up-phase","slug":"start-up-phase","title":"Start-Up Phase","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-08T15:19:00+01:00","created_at":"2012-09-04T15:17:48+01:00","tag_ids":[]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"Part of the ODI\u2019s mission is to help startups unlock innovation using open data. \r\n\r\nODI startups have generated more than \u00a31m over the past 12 months.\r\n","excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/31/62/5331622cd0d4620771000066/odi_logo_3.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"attachment-5331622cf362be1b91000076\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Be an ODI startup</h3>\n\n<p>Part of the ODI\u2019s mission is to help startups unlock innovation using open data. </p>\n\n<p>ODI startups have generated more than \u00a31m over the past 12 months.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/31/6a/53316a071f986a2ef000010a/odi_startup_mastadon.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"attachment-53316a061f986a62e300008c\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Testimonials</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We feel privileged to have played a small part in such an exciting and dynamic organisation and have no hesitation in recommending the programme to other open data startups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Ian Makgill, MD, Spend Network</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Being based at the ODI has helped us hugely.

Tasked with overseeing the Freedom of Information Act and Data Protection Act regimes, it\u2019s a fitting role for an ex-journalist practiced in matters pertaining to public interest (Christopher was previously a current affairs producer for BBC radio and TV, then a Managing Editor of news programmes for TV and Radio).  </p>\n\n<p>Here Christopher tells us more about his involvement in the upcoming ODI Summit (October 29th) and what \u201copen\u201d means to him. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What will you be talking about at the Summit?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Open data and the right to information go hand in hand. Open data needs the &lsquo;pull&rsquo; of Freedom of Information (FOI) as well as the &lsquo;push&rsquo; of proactive publication. The FOI request process promotes a continual evaluation of what information should be released, encouraging pro-active publication. Now, with the dataset amendments, it makes an explicit link between access and re-use.</p>\n\n<p>Public authorities should adopt a &lsquo;transparency by design&rsquo; approach. They should be thinking about what information should be released as open data, at an early stage in projects and procurement. Data protection is not a barrier to open data, but increasing publication of open data increases the risk of inadvertently disclosing personal data. What are the tools to mitigate this risk?</p>\n\n<p>I want to create a conversation about the relationship between open data, the right to information and privacy. We can only build transparency and trust if we factor in all three. </p>\n\n<p>I also want to ask how far open data extends into the private sector, in a world where public services are increasingly delivered by other operators. Does open data follow the public pound?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which innovation or discovery in open data has most surprised you?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The far-reaching application of the dataset amendments to the Freedom of Information Act. There is now a requirement, confirmed in statute, for every public authority, of whatever size, to make datasets available as open data when they are releasing information under the Act, as far as reasonably practicable. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What direction do you see open data heading in over the next five years, and what most excites you about the future?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The most exciting prospect is that open data can become business as usual. The open data agenda will have achieved its aim when it becomes routine for public authorities in all sectors and at all levels to publish open data as part of their normal business practices. </p>\n\n<p>As the number of councils, cities and countries opening up their data increases, which sector do you think stands to gain the most (business, government, commercial, environmental, etc.) and why? </p>\n\n<p>There is a vital role \u2013and therefore a business opportunity \u2013 for intermediaries. Open data in itself is of limited use to individuals. It has to be used (and made useful) in order to add value. Intermediaries take the open data and create visualisations, apps and products. Open data is the resource that enables them to turn a good idea into a business, and benefit citizens and consumers. Furthermore, making the data more easily visible highlights potential efficiency savings which benefit government as well. </p>\n\n<p><em>Christopher joins Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt, Martha Lane Fox CBE and a host of other key figures for the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://summit.theodi.org\">Open Data Institute\u2019s first Annual Summit and Gala Dinner</a> (October 29) at the Museum of London.

Data (mere mention of the word will strike fear into some people\u2019s hearts) is all around us, and is increasing by the exabyte.\u0002\nLuckily there are plenty of ways to get your data engaged, analysed and working for you. The ODI\u2019s first-ever incubating business, Mastodon C are working with businesses and government to help them unlock the power of their data.\u0002\nWe spoke to Francine Bennett, CEO at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mastodonc.com/\">Mastodon C</a>, about her involvement in the upcoming <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\">Open Data Institute\u0002Summit</a> (October 29th).</p>\n\n<p>\u0002\n<strong>What will you be talking about at the Open Data Summit?</strong>\u0002\nI hope to be having discussions about how to really put open data to work for business, social, and environmental benefit. We&rsquo;re all about turning raw data into the outcomes that an organisation needs.\u0002\n\u0002\n<strong>Which innovation or discovery in open data has most surprised you?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think the willingness of organisations to actually issue open data has been a very pleasant surprise, and something that&rsquo;s borne fruit in getting the movement off the ground. For example, we\u2019ve made a lot of use of the NHS\u2019s GP prescribing datasets, which are a fantastically rich resource.\u0002\n\u0002\n<strong>What direction do you see open data heading in over the next five years, and what most excites you about the future?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a very new field, so I hope to see it become standard practice to create and use large amounts of open data for all types of organisations over the next five years. Working with data can be a complex thing, so I don\u2019t expect everyone to become experts, but I do think that critical thinking about data is going to be a big part of people\u2019s jobs as we have more and more data available to help us in thinking and decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>\u0002\n<strong>As the number of councils, cities and countries opening up their data increases, which sector do you think stands to gain the most (business, government, commercial, environmental, etc.) and why?\u0002</strong></p>\n\n<p>All of them! I&rsquo;d particularly like to see government and the environmental sector use open data to understand where to use resources best, so that nothing is wasted. Data can help the people deploying the resources to figure out how to use them - for example, I really love this example of New York City using predictive modelling on data to send their limited number of building inspectors to take care of the most dangerous issues first.\u0002\n\u0002\nFrancine will be speaking more about the usefulness of open data for businesses at the first annual Open Data Summit (October 29th, Museum of London). Split into four unique sessions (each approaching the open data movement from a unique angle), a film screening, and a Gala Dinner (including presentation from Sir Tim Berners-Lee) the Summit will asses open data\u2019s impact on government, business and society.</p>\n\n<p>Francine can be found on Twitter as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/fhr\">@fhr</a></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Matthew Sykes","slug":"matthew-sykes","web_url":"http://theodi.org/matthew-sykes","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Matthew Sykes","slug":"matthew-sykes","web_url":"http://theodi.org/matthew-sykes","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-qa-with-julie-freeman.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-summit-qa-with-julie-freeman","slug":"odi-summit-qa-with-julie-freeman","title":"ODI Summit: Q&A with Julie Freeman","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:33+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-25T10:54:14+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-qa-dr-loren-treisman.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-summit-qa-dr-loren-treisman","slug":"odi-summit-qa-dr-loren-treisman","title":"ODI Summit: Q&A with Dr Loren Treisman","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:05+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-16T11:44:08+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-qa-michael-flowers.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-summit-qa-michael-flowers","slug":"odi-summit-qa-michael-flowers","title":"ODI Summit: Q&A with Michael Flowers","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:06+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-17T09:40:04+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"With so much focus being placed on the commercial and political applications for open data resources, you\u2019d be forgiven for overlooking the fact that data can be a quite beautiful thing.

We asked Julie a couple of questions about what we can expect from the session.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What will you be talking about at the Open Data Summit? What kind of conversation do you hope to create or enhance?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve convened the Data as Culture session at the summit. It&rsquo;s a great line up with speakers from the BBC, Science Museum, Europeana, Museum of London and Lighthouse Digital Culture Agency so we will be having a conversation about the various roles that data plays within the cultural sector, how open data will change the processes of providing and consuming culture.</p>\n\n<p>We will look at:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>data generated by cultural organisations and activities</li>\n  <li>data that is cultural content</li>\n  <li>artists and artworks that use data as a material</li>\n  <li>critical discourse, exhibitions and informational material that elucidates data within today&rsquo;s culture</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the background to the panel?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Open Data Institute sees the creative use of data as an intrinsic and essential part of our cultural landscape. As part of it\u2019s ongoing operations, the it has an art programme committed to facilitating artists in the exhibition and creation of works which translate data into something that is meaningful to people\u2019s lives.</p>\n\n<p>In September 2012, the ODI published an open call for participation in an exhibition at their new premises. In two weeks, we received 89 proposals of work, from 21 countries. Nine works were selected for their diversity of data use, and their cohesion as a whole collection. Only one was screen based - the idea of the web \u201cbreaking through the glass\u201d and becoming part of our physical world could not be more timely, and significant, to the work of the ODI.</p>\n\n<p>In 2014 the Data as Culture programme will see a geographically dispersed exhibition, spanning London, Brighton, Manchester and beyond.</p>\n\n<p><em>There\u2019s now less than one week to go before the Open Data Institute\u2019s First Annual Summit and Gala Dinner (Tuesday October 29). Alongside Julie\u2019s Data as Culture session, topics to be discussed include open data in finance and politics, and the role of open data in business. After a day of keynotes, fireside chats and lighting speeches, Sir Tim Berners-Lee will address an exclusive Gala Dinner.</em></p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Matthew Sykes","slug":"matthew-sykes","web_url":"http://theodi.org/matthew-sykes","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Matthew Sykes","slug":"matthew-sykes","web_url":"http://theodi.org/matthew-sykes","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-qa-with-kevin-merritt.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-summit-qa-with-kevin-merritt","slug":"odi-summit-qa-with-kevin-merritt","title":"ODI Summit: Q&A with Kevin Merritt","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:38+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-25T12:31:03+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-qa-dr-loren-treisman.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-summit-qa-dr-loren-treisman","slug":"odi-summit-qa-dr-loren-treisman","title":"ODI Summit: Q&A with Dr Loren Treisman","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:05+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-16T11:44:08+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-summit-qa-with-martin-tisne.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/odi-summit-qa-with-martin-tisne","slug":"odi-summit-qa-with-martin-tisne","title":"ODI Summit: Q&A with Martin Tisne","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:36+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-24T16:06:49+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Data, data, everywhere, but hardly a chance to think.

The collaboration of different viewpoints brings new resources to old problems, and expedites the rate at which we solve those problems.</p>\n\n<p>\u0002\n<strong>As the number of councils, cities and countries opening up their data increases, which sector do you think stands to gain the most (business, government, commercial, environmental, etc.) and why?\u0002</strong></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a tough question, but the reality is that the government cannot succeed without business and commercial success, environmental cannot succeed without business success, etc. There are many constituencies for open data, and open data should be viewed as a non-controversial digital infrastructure that the Government is providing. But in order to keep it as a public good, and to justify the expense associated with open data development, governments will have to prove value in each of these fields listed and beyond, including education, healthcare, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Michael Flowers joins a stellar line up of speakers for the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\">Open Data Institute\u2019s first annual Summit</a>.

It demonstrates how new collaborations between the arts and business sectors continue to drive exciting arts initiatives throughout the UK.</p>\n\n<p>In 2012, as a brand new organisation with no prior engagement with the arts, the ODI sponsored the female-focused organisation MzTEK to become a partner in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/culture\">Data as Culture</a> programme. MzTEK not only had access to artists working in the field of new media, computer arts and technology but could also ensure a balanced demographic was reached in the commissioning process. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Sophie McDonald</strong>, MzTEK and co-curator of the first Data as Culture exhibition, said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeing a partner in the Data as Culture programme was an exciting opportunity for MzTEK to expand our curatorial practice, reach new audiences and support female data artists to apply for the data-driven art commissions, an area which is predominantly a male domain.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Julie Freeman</strong>, Open Data Institute Art Associate and co-curator of Data as Culture said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe impact of the Data as Culture art programme has been significant not only to the ODI community but in the wider context of the arts.

We want to ensure conversations about open data expand beyond specialist communities and through to the general public. Using data as a material increases awareness of what data is, how it can be used creatively, how it can inspire, encourage play and lateral thinking, and help people share stories and experiences.

What happens now on the back of this report is crucial in unlocking the value of open data. If the Government is serious about making data open, it has to be made available and fast.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Executive order</strong></p>\n\n<p>Last week, the White House issued an\u0002<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf\">executive order</a>\u0002requiring all US federal government data to be open and machine-readable. \u0002Whilst the ODI supports the recommendations in today\u2019s report, both CEO, Starks and Chairman, Nigel Shadbolt, do not want the UK falling behind the US. They would have liked to see bolder statements of intent around two important areas: aiding innovation and ensuring data sets are published.</p>\n\n<p>Gavin Starks says: \u201cWhilst the report provides a solid set of recommendations, the ODI would like to have seen a greater emphasis placed on the role\u0002that public sector information can play in innovation. When it comes to open data, the UK has the leadership position, so why aren&rsquo;t\u0002we being more ambitious?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He continues, \u201cThe role of the ODI is to turn ambition into innovation and help new start-ups to thrive. But here we are, at the brink of something that will enable us to bring about a revolution - a web of data on a par with the existing web - and we are backing away and being cautious when we could be bold. The Government is a key customer for innovation and its leadership cannot be underestimated.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>ODI role</strong></p>\n\n<p>The valuable role of the ODI in driving innovation forward is highlighted in today\u2019s report: \u201cAs an example of innovation, we have the Open Data Institute. Co-funded by government and business, the ODI is well-placed to demonstrate the value latent in Public Sector Information (PSI), for example through building the demand side for PSI (including public sector use of its own data and incubating start-ups), and training business to best exploit and innovate with the data released by government.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Forming part of the recommendations by Shakespeare is the establishment of and access to, National Core Reference Data (the most important data held by each government department and other publicly funded bodies).</p>\n\n<p>Nigel Shadbolt, the ODI\u2019s Chairman comments: \u201cWe are pleased that the report highlights the importance of a national core data function. But what needs to happen now is to identify core data sets and ensure they are published \u2013 that calls for clear leadership from the Government.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAs with the recent executive order in the US, the ODI would like to see a legal duty placed on public bodies to create and maintain the core reference data. To strengthen trust in the on-going availability and consistency of this data, this legal duty should be supplemented by a power in legislation for a Secretary of State to designate uniform resource identifiers (URIs) for this core reference data. This way we can provide universal and linked access to the core data on which future business and government will depend.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information\">Read the full Shakespeare Report</a></p>\n\n<p>Read about the ODI&rsquo;s\u0002<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/consultation-response/independent-public-sector-information-review\">Open Data Market Makers</a>\u0002event, convened in March to inform the Shakespeare report</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-celebrates-new-year-obe-for-technical-director-jeni-tennison.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-celebrates-new-year-obe-for-technical-director-jeni-tennison","slug":"odi-celebrates-new-year-obe-for-technical-director-jeni-tennison","title":"ODI celebrates New Year OBE for Technical Director, Jeni Tennison ","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:34+01:00","created_at":"2013-12-30T20:34:01+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/jeni-tennison.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","title":"Jeni Tennison","format":"person","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:05+01:00","created_at":"2012-09-11T13:53:20+01:00","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"ODI founders, Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Sir Tim Berners-Lee have welcomed the news that Technical Director, Jeni Tennison has received an OBE in the New Year\u2019s Honours.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p>ODI founders, Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Sir Tim Berners-Lee have welcomed the news that Technical Director, Jeni Tennison has received an OBE in the New Year\u2019s Honours.</p>\n\n<p>Jeni, who grew up in Cambridge, first trained as a psychologist before gaining a PhD in collaborative ontology development from the University of Nottingham. </p>\n\n<p>Before joining the ODI, she was the technical architect and lead developer for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk\">legislation.gov.uk</a>, which pioneered the use of open data APIs within the public sector, set a new standard in the publication of legislation on the web, and formed the basis of The National Archives\u2019 strategy for bringing the UK\u2019s legislation up to date as open, public data.\nSpeaking about today\u2019s Honour, ODI Chairman, Sir Nigel Shadbolt said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Jeni inspires affection, loyalty and admiration in all who know her.

Working in residence at the Open Data Institute has enabled me to work with data in a deep way, interrogating it as an art material, looking for the growth, momentum and fragility within it.

The Nodes bring together companies, universities and NGOs that support open data projects and communities.</p>\n\n<p>Since its official opening in December 2012, the ODI has been inundated with requests from across the world, asking for support to set up country-wide or regional versions of the organisation. Over the past six months, the ODI has engaged with dozens of people around the world, in an open process, to co-create this network. </p>\n\n<p>Two Nodes are country-wide trials with NGOs in the USA and Canada. Eight are city or regional Nodes: ODI Dubai, ODI Chicago, ODI North Carolina, ODI Paris, ODI Trento, ODI Manchester, ODI Brighton, and ODI Leeds. The final three are communications-focused: ODI Gothenburg, ODI Moscow, ODI Buenos Aires (see details below on the three types of nodes). </p>\n\n<p>The announcement marks the start of a substantial international open data network. An official signing ceremony will take place during the first annual ODI Summit at the Museum of London.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gavin Starks, CEO at the ODI said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have been amazed at the energy and enthusiasm of people looking to align around a global network of ODIs. The speed at which we have been able to collaborate,the shared thinking about the approach and the scale of the potential, indicate that the ODI is an idea whose time has come. We have borrowed from the design principles of the web itself to bring people and organisations together, and will use open data both to collaborate with each other, and as the primary output of the network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Open Data Institute \u2013 the first organisation of its kind \u2013 grew out of our belief in the power of open data to foster innovation, drive economic growth and create prosperity. The fact that only one year on, cities and countries around the world want to adopt the ODI model, is evidence of how quickly the open data revolution is spreading. The establishment of ODI Nodes in UK cities will help embed an open data culture in communities, and bring the economic benefits of new and innovative data-led businesses that will help the UK compete in the global race.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>About the Nodes</h3>\n\n<p>Each Node has agreed to adopt the ODI Charter, which is an open source codification of the ODI itself, and embodies principles of open data business, publishing, communication, and collaboration. </p>\n\n<p>The creation of ODI Nodes around the world highlights how people are using the power of open data to combine expertise and resources. Each Node will catalyse open data culture within their own communities and communicate open data success stories globally. City and regional Nodes will identify open data collaboration projects, and publish data relating to themselves and their work using open standards such as the ODI Open Data Certificate. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The three types of Node</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Country Nodes: Independent NGOs who are building national centres of excellence, working across public and private sectors, NGOs, educational institutions and other Nodes within the country. ODI USA and ODI Canada are currently in &ldquo;beta&rdquo; to reflect their startup status.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>City or Regional Nodes deliver projects, and can provide training, research, and development. ODI Dubai, ODI Chicago, and ODI North Carolina, ODI Paris, ODI Trento, ODI Brighton, ODI Manchester, ODI Leeds fall into this category.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Communications Nodes amplify open data case studies from around the world and promote understanding. ODI Moscow, ODI Buenos Aires and ODI Gothenburg have joined at this level. </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Organisations act as hosts for the city, regional and communications Nodes: these are businesses, universities and NGO\u2019s. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Waldo Jaquith, Founder of ODI USA, said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The United States has a vibrant, fast-growing open data ecosystem. The ODI provides a model that can help to catalyse and connect the organizations, governments, businesses, and individuals who are doing brilliant work with open data. It&rsquo;s time to bring the ODI model to the United States.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Dennis Brink, Co-Founder of ODI Canada, said:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Joining the International network of ODI Nodes is a great opportunity for the Canadian Open Data Institute and we are honoured to be a part of this global network. Its ongoing development allows us to gain from the experience that the ODI brings to the open data and governance space through its initiatives. We expect this to have a positive impact on our ability to successfully deliver on initiatives and to connect all Canadians with the open data movement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Ibrahim Elbadawi, ODI Dubai, Managing Director, Exantium, United Arab Emirates</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are excited to announce this partnership with the ODI, which will enable us to collaborate and bring the knowledge, expertise and best practices in the emerging domain of open data to the Arab region. Open data as a culture and practice can help societies find innovative solutions for today\u2019s multi-faceted challenges. We will offer government and non government organisations in the region localised versions of the ODI\u2019s open data training programs and promote the use of ODI Certificates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-hails-mps-demand-for-greater-transparency-in-public-sector-outsourcing.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-hails-mps-demand-for-greater-transparency-in-public-sector-outsourcing","slug":"odi-hails-mps-demand-for-greater-transparency-in-public-sector-outsourcing","title":"ODI hails MPs\u2019 demand for greater transparency in public sector outsourcing","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:46+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-14T12:43:45+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/new-startups-announced-reducing-government-energy-costs-and-shining-light-public-sector.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/new-startups-announced-reducing-government-energy-costs-and-shining-light-public-sector","slug":"new-startups-announced-reducing-government-energy-costs-and-shining-light-public-sector","title":"New startups announced - reducing Government energy costs and shining light on public sector spending ","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:00+01:00","created_at":"2013-08-28T07:29:18+01:00","tag_ids":["news"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"The ODI has welcomed calls by MPs for increased transparency in Government procurement.","excerpt":"The ODI has welcomed calls by MPs for increased transparency in Government procurement.

The company estimated that a delay of 53 days, caused by a tendering process that is 45% slower than the EU averages, delays \u00a3734m of cash flow to UK SMEs each year.

The organisation is currently developing <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/public-procurement/blob/master/guide.md\">a guide</a> for public sector organisations to build open data into the delivery of public services through the procurement process. Over the next year, ODI will be training over 120 procurement officers in government about how to embed transparency about performance and costs into contracts.</p>\n\n<p>The ODI\u2019s Technical Director, Jeni Tennison said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Embedding transparency and open data into contracts requires a change of attitude, culture and mindset. We are providing concrete, practical help for procurement officers and contract managers, through the guides and training that we are putting together, to deploy open data to enhance transparency, improve efficiency and drive innovation. We are working with a number of private sector companies who are already seeing the benefits of opening up data. We would like to see more organisations, including those supplying services to government, being proactive and becoming open by default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"The ODI has welcomed calls by MPs for increased transparency in Government procurement.","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-launches-850k-scheme-create-businesses-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-launches-850k-scheme-create-businesses-open-data","slug":"odi-launches-850k-scheme-create-businesses-open-data","title":"ODI launches \u00a3850k scheme to create businesses from open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:28+01:00","created_at":"2013-02-21T23:03:15+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The Open Data Institute (ODI) has unveiled a new initiative that will accelerate innovative open data ideas and develop market-ready businesses.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p>The Open Data Institute (ODI) has unveiled a new initiative that will accelerate innovative open data ideas and develop market-ready businesses.</p>\n\n<p>The Open Data Immersion Programme will consist of a series of events run over three years, convening a range of data owners and data users.

Gavin Starks said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis new programme is a great way to help ideas emerge. All new businesses are hard work, and open data businesses have their own specific challenges. We will help shorten the path between ideas, experts, and funding: applying structured and rapid feedback within a time-limited programme that will help surface and refine those which show the greatest promise.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>First series</strong></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/events/immersion-programme\">The first series </a>to be explored through the Immersion Programme is Crime and Justice, beginning in March. Participants will work with a range of specialists and industry experts including for example, police forces, government departments, private security companies and charities. Attendees will innovate using datasets that may include crime data, sentencing statistics, poverty measures and rates of re-offending.</p>\n\n<p>Further planned Immersion Programme series in 2013 include Energy and the Environment and Personal Data.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-partners-manchester-future-everything-summit.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-partners-manchester-future-everything-summit","slug":"odi-partners-manchester-future-everything-summit","title":"ODI partners with Manchester Future Everything Summit ","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:34+01:00","created_at":"2013-03-20T18:29:26+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The FutureEverything Summit of Ideas and Digital Invention gets underway in Manchester today (Thursday) with the support of the ODI.

The tools allow citizens and policymakers to personally investigate the effects of the plans using open data for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://london-fire.labs.theodi.org\">tools</a> show the pattern of effects, based on two parameters: fire service <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/package/london-fire-brigade-incident-records\">response times to incidents</a>, and data relating to mobile phone activity in particular parts of London across the day, estimating the number of people present in the area, and how many are likely to be affected at those times (crowd data).</p>\n\n<p>Using just two datasets, the maps and diagrams generated by the researchers show the potential effects of shutting the 10 fire stations earmarked for closure. The work is significant because using the crowd data meant that the ODI could measure the impact of the closures in light of the number of people potentially affected, including those who are visiting temporarily as well as the fixed population.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers could then \u201crate\u201d London boroughs that might have similar fire response times but very different populations.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers conclude that the effect would be even more compelling with the addition of data including the quality and age of the equipment used and the capacity of the fire stations, which are not currently available as open data.</p>\n\n<h3>Better policy making</h3>\n\n<p>This is the first time that Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s aggregated and anonymised crowd data has been used to inform understanding of the impact of changes to public services in this way. With the ODI\u2019s assistance, the company will soon make the data openly and publicly available for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Computer modelling is already used worldwide to help make decisions about emergency service provision. However this takes place largely in closed environments, not accessible to the general public. By building tools in an open way, the ODI set out to show how open data can aid transparency in policy-making and give citizens direct access to information. This could help build public confidence in policy decisions and the way they are reached.</p>\n\n<p>Although the initial pilot has focused on the London FIre Brigade, the tools created by the ODI team could be applied to any emergency services dataset. The ODI is inviting others to get involved by refining and adding to the data and processes.</p>\n\n<p>The ODI\u2019s Gavin Starks said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bringing together Telef\u00f3nica crowd data with data from the London Datastore helps demonstrate the power of combining public and private sector open data. We expect to see a lot of innovation in this kind of collaboration and are really pleased to see Telef\u00f3nica commit to taking steps to open up data for everyone. We see huge potential to improve policy-making and transparency, to build trust with and create new tools for citizens, and to help create new commercial services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Steve Alder, CEO Telef\u00f3nica Dynamic Insights\u2019 said: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We believe that aggregated and anonymous crowd data - approached in a smart and responsible way - has the potential to transform every part of business and society. In particular, as this research project shows, aggregated and anonymous crowd data can help business and government bodies make big decisions better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The work will be discussed later today at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\">the ODI\u2019s first annual Summit</a> </p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-seeks-crime-and-justice-data-startups-ahead-blue-light-hackathons-weekend.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-seeks-crime-and-justice-data-startups-ahead-blue-light-hackathons-weekend","slug":"odi-seeks-crime-and-justice-data-startups-ahead-blue-light-hackathons-weekend","title":"ODI seeks crime and justice data startups ahead of  blue light hackathons this weekend","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:42+01:00","created_at":"2013-04-24T13:39:48+01:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The ODI (Open Data Institute) is seeking digital startups, SME\u2019s and developers interested in creating innovative new services from crime and justice data, to take part in its Immersion Programme.

The minister in charge of the TSB, David Willetts said the ODI\u2019s mission to train a new cohort of open data developers through its post-graduate diploma and other courses will be crucial:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe need cutting edge scientists to write systems for the very large data sets that we have, making them more usable and adding to the flow of data. We need to generate skills to analyse data, this isn\u2019t something you can\u2019t do without education and training\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Affiliations</strong></p>\n\n<p>The main features of the agreement with the World Bank will be to help collect evidence globally on the benefits of open data and to train senior people who will lead open data initiatives in developing countries. Andrew Stott, Senior Consultant with the World Bank and member of the Cabinet Office Transparency Board said: \u201cI am delighted that the ODI and the World Bank will be working together to deliver first class open data programmes in the developing world\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Announcing the affiliation with the World Bank, CEO Gavin Starks said: \u201cThis agreement is further evidence of the momentum being generated by open data. That organisations like the World Bank and Omidyar Network are stepping forward to work with us demonstrates the emerging open data culture. Organisations should no longer be asking themselves <u>if</u> they should open up their data but <u>how</u>\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/long-held-ambition-realised-odi-opens-officially\">Read Nigel Shadbolt&rsquo;s blog</a> about the ODI official opening</em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-signs-open-data-memorandum-of-understanding-with-republic-of-korea.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-signs-open-data-memorandum-of-understanding-with-republic-of-korea","slug":"odi-signs-open-data-memorandum-of-understanding-with-republic-of-korea","title":"ODI signs open data Memorandum of Understanding with Republic of Korea","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:48+01:00","created_at":"2013-11-14T20:56:04+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"The Open Data Institute has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Information Society Agency (NIA) of the Republic of Korea.

Since the project began in January 2013, Demand Logic has identified:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Energy savings of \u00a3390,000 per year</li>\n  <li>Carbon savings of 2500 tonnes per year</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This latest initiative covers three campuses: Guy\u2019s, Denmark Hill and the Strand. Approximately 100 buildings ranging considerably in size and usage pattern were involved in the project, over 1500 plant items were tracked (including boilers, pumps and air-conditioning units) and over 100,000 sensors and devices were monitored.</p>\n\n<p>The Demand Logic platform identifies energy saving opportunities in the heating, cooling and ventilation systems which are extremely hard to pinpoint in large, complex buildings. The system works by analysing data generated by the building control systems, which often stays hidden.</p>\n\n<p>Demand Logic found that the College&rsquo;s facilities were generally running very efficiently, and their controls were excellent. But a lack of data analysis capability meant that many problems had not been found.</p>\n\n<p>In one case, boilers were rapidly cycling on and off because they did not have enough load. The team also found several conflicting &ldquo;set points&rdquo; (temperature settings) had been applied to the same open plan office, causing both heating and cooling of the same space.</p>\n\n<p>In one particular instance, having discovered a large chiller running all day in the middle of winter, the system then found a single office that was causing the problem. This room was being heated by a personal electric heater which was fighting the centralised cooling plant. This discovery was only possible because the Demand Logic system monitors hundreds of ceiling-mounted air-conditioning outlets in the building, and was able to identify one which was demanding more from the central plant.</p>\n\n<p>Mike Darby, Chief Technical Officer, Demand Logic, said:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is just the beginning at King&rsquo;s. The system found the low-hanging fruit quite early on, and then we focussed on developing even better methods for analysing data. Now these are going live, I am convinced we&rsquo;ll find many more savings.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Ian Armitage, Campus Operations Manager at King&rsquo;s College London, said:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe that good control systems in buildings are the key to saving energy without compromising user comfort. Demand Logic has helped the College to find a host of issues about how our heating and cooling plant is controlled, leading to significant savings which we are using to fund investment in our student facing facilities. Our campus buildings generate a vast amount of data, but accessing and analysing this is a real challenge. The Demand Logic web system allows us to see at a glance where problems are likely to be. Without this, it&rsquo;s like trying to find a needle in a haystack.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Gavin Starks, CEO of the Open Data Institute said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEnergy efficiency is an easy way to save money, but if you\u2019re not measuring it you can\u2019t manage it. Demand Logic\u2019s latest project highlights how you can both save money, and increase sustainability - at a time when fuel bills are rising and the latest IPCC report continues to highlight the urgent need for action.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u0002</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Helen Desmond","slug":"helen-desmond","web_url":"http://theodi.org/helen-desmond","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Helen Desmond","slug":"helen-desmond","web_url":"http://theodi.org/helen-desmond","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/new-data-analysis-by-odi-startup-shows-uk-businesses-starved-of-22bn-in-cash-flow.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/new-data-analysis-by-odi-startup-shows-uk-businesses-starved-of-22bn-in-cash-flow","slug":"new-data-analysis-by-odi-startup-shows-uk-businesses-starved-of-22bn-in-cash-flow","title":"ODI startup reveals UK businesses starved of \u00a322bn in cash flow by government inefficiencies","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:41+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-09T21:59:50+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"ODI start-up, Spend Network has revealed that up to \u00a322bn of government cash, intended for the UK economy, is being delayed by an inefficient tendering system.

It also needs to take steps to ensure that the transfer of public data to the private sector never happens again, particularly in the context of proposals to change Land Registry to become a government-owned company. We look forward to reading the Government\u2019s response to the PASC report.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Image Flickr:</strong> <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mauricedb/2706292588/sizes/l/in/photolist-589sv3-5eKgMt-5ePFFU-5yPxrt-5yPGsk-5yPKmD-5yPUVc-5yPXi2-5yTNuQ-5yU7Qu-5yUaAo-kgvoqX-fvVK1t-iLJ6V6-7Zv9Md-7ZrYpv-7ZZD7e-7Zv9Gy-eYYgYm-e8rjkm-htNXJQ-c2JWAb-dAce6r-hEWK3q-dxDFxg-fFtqsL-f3jACC-9LA1nu-7Zv9yA-cNqHbN-eYLTQp-9LxFVB-ah78um-c3sAKw-hGpNeH-cYkW3o-fq953B-e1mEV1-cW3sDu-cAkDLU-bWefYE-gUp9yF-e2pY4h-eS9yTJ-dC4iPj-c58PdQ-dobG5f-hTG48T-bpMD9E-kJgMoB-kxW9nt/\">** Maurice **</a></p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"The ODI","slug":"the-odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/the-odi","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-based-company-helps-londoners-understand-mayor-s-policing-plans.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-based-company-helps-londoners-understand-mayor-s-policing-plans","slug":"odi-based-company-helps-londoners-understand-mayor-s-policing-plans","title":"ODI-based Company Helps Londoners Understand Mayor\u2019s Policing Plans","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:29+01:00","created_at":"2013-02-28T08:48:47+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"A start-up company based at the Open Data Institute has developed interactive mapping tools to help people see how the planned closure of police stations in the Capital will affect them.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p>A start-up company based at the Open Data Institute has developed <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.frontcounters.org.uk\">interactive mapping tools</a> to help people see how the planned closure of police stations in the Capital will affect them.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/case-study/locatable\">Locatable</a> has built the maps using Transport for London&rsquo;s journey planner database.

If you read the earlier post you&rsquo;ll probably detect my mild irritation with the term when coupled with the second of these interpretations. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the redundancy, or maybe the implication that plain &lsquo;science&rsquo; is somehow devoid of data. It may be both.</p>\n\n<p>However, irritation aside, there is no doubt that the commoditisation of high performance/distributed computing and data analysis tools are creating new avenues for scientific enquiry where data volumes may previously have been a barrier. Couple this with the increasing wealth and volume of open data available to researchers and we have unprecedented opportunities to &lsquo;do science with data&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Wind this scenario forward a few steps though and we hit some interesting questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What are the implications of &lsquo;doing science&rsquo; with open data?  </li>\n  <li>What changes are required in how we approach scientific methods and findings based on open data?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, when Open Data is your raw material, the essence of data science fundamentally changes. In the remainder of this post I will explore how the operating context fundamentally shapes the nature of your data science.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a scenario involving the fictional characters Darius and Diana. Darius works for AnyOrg, a large organisation brimming with data. The specific commercial activities of AnyOrg are not really important beyond the fact that it generates and exploits large volumes of its own data in the course of everyday business; it could be a drug company, an online retailer, or a political campaign team.</p>\n\n<p>In his role as data scientist at AnyOrg, Darius designs experimental protocols that allow him to test hypotheses pertinent to the objectives of the organisation. Central to these protocols is the collection of data at source: this may be in the lab, from A/B testing on e-commerce sites, or from polls of voters. Being rather forward-thinking, the AnyOrg management has decided to publish a number of its data assets as open data, including the results of many of Darius&rsquo; experiments &ndash; they understand that this can generate novel insights and value for the organisation by allowing an ecosystem to develop around the data.</p>\n\n<p>Diana is also a data scientist. She has an existing research programme that&rsquo;s producing interesting results, but the data from AnyOrg could enable something truly groundbreaking. Diana reformulates her research plan to include additional analyses based on data from her own experiments mixed with open data from AnyOrg. And here&rsquo;s the rub. What guarantees does Diana have about the quality of the data from AnyOrg? None whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>If the data released was something simple like a product database then the issue is less acute, though Diana would be sensible to ask what guarantees were available about the comprehensiveness of the data set and the accuracy of product descriptions it might contain. Does that resolve the problem? No way.</p>\n\n<p>Consider an alternative scenario where the data from AnyOrg is based on any kind of experimentation or analysis. What guarantees does Diana have about the quality of Darius&rsquo; experimental protocols? What hypotheses were being tested? Are these fully documented? Which sampling methods did he use? Is the result representative of the broader population about which claims are being made? Were the code or queries used to collect the data rigorously tested? Where the data includes summary statistics, were these accurately computed?</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the answer to these questions, if Diana is looking to publish her findings in a peer-reviewed conference or journal she needs to be able to convince the reviewers that her methodology and analysis are robust, and that extends to the data she depends on that was collected elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this mean for doing data science with open data? Well firstly, the challenges are actually not unique to an open data context, it just brings them more sharply into focus. If Darius has a colleague who wants to base further analysis on his data there is at least a chance of her walking down the corridor or sending an email and asking Darius questions about the protocol he used. In a world of open data this kind of exchange may still happen, but there are fewer guarantees that it actually could. Where does this leave us?</p>\n\n<p>In a way nothing has changed. It is still paramount that we, as scientists, are realistic about the claims we make based on the results of our research. Now more than ever, in a potential world of more connected research, we need to scrutinise the work of others and along more dimensions. This is bread and butter stuff for scientists, but it requires full disclosure of the process, which in some disciplines is nowhere near as commonplace as it should be.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately there is extensive ongoing work exploring publication of scientific data under open licenses. These efforts should yield new technical standards that enable scientists to express the finer points of their experimental protocols in a way that both fosters reuse of the data and satisfies the rigour of the peer review process. We are also seeing early signs that journals are willing to accept a broader definition of the term &lsquo;publication&rsquo;, stretching from traditional research papers to well-documented, reusable data sets. This in turn provides an incentive for scientists to fully document and openly publish their data.</p>\n\n<p>All of these factors point to a world of previously unforeseen potential, where open data enables a wealth of novel data analysis without requiring us to comprise our scientific principles.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Tom Heath","slug":"tom-heath","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/tom-heath","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Tom Heath","slug":"tom-heath","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/tom-heath","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/joining-odi.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/joining-odi","slug":"joining-odi","title":"On joining the ODI","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:04+01:00","created_at":"2012-09-12T00:05:58+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"During the Olympics Opening Ceremony, the creator of the web tweeted \u201cThis is for everyone\u201d to millions of people around the world.

Open Data creates the potential for anyone to innovate. The web was created using, and exists because of, open source and open data. I want to explore how we can best deliver; - data presented in a structured, \u201cmachine-readable\u201d form so that data can be used bvy and between services (for example, using Apps)\n- data that is addressable via the internet and can therefore be linked together</p>\n\n<p>I believe that <em>&ldquo;information causes change, otherwise it&rsquo;s not information&rdquo;</em><br />\nJames Burke, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://archive.dconstruct.org/2012/admiralshovel\">dconstruct 2012</a></p>\n\n<p>There are massive <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/advice/poi/power-of-information-review.pdf\">benefits</a> of getting this right. Governments, businesses, and individuals around the world are gradually coming to understand the power of data. The World Economic Forum has now categorised Personal Data as a new \u201cAsset Class\u201d: <em>\u201cPersonal data is the new oil of the Internet<br />\nand the new currency of the digital world.\u201d</em><br />\nMeglena Kuneva, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_ITTC_PersonalDataNewAsset_Report_2011.pdf\">European Consumer Commissioner</a></p>\n\n<p>And this is just the beginning: there is an emerging shift in our collective understanding of the power of connected, addressable information. The ODI will help us reveal this power, guide us towards best practices, fair usage, and empower a new generation of innovators to create value - and in this definition I include economic, environmental, and social value. <strong>What is Data?</strong> This may seem like an obvious question, and to help anchor our language I want to be clear what this means. We live in an age where almost everything is, or will be, digitised. We are familiar with government spending data, health statistics, company financial reports, school assessments, and our own personal records. We are less familiar with data that is collected when we (as governments, businesses, or individuals) use the web, or devices that generate new data (such as location data from your mobile phone, or using Facebook). I see two trends here: one is a growing set of opportunities for innovation \u2013 creating new services that improve our lives, the other is a growing sense of anxiety \u2013 that we are monitored and not in control of our information. I want to address both these areas. <strong>What is Open Data?</strong> Firstly Open Data does not mean \u201call data\u201d, or that it&rsquo;s a free-for-all. For example, your personal health data is extremely private. There are benefits, for example aggregated anonymous statistical analysis can help us make better decisions. There are also risks \u2013 we know that companies, governments, and individuals are not always as well equipped to handle information as we may want. <strong>Examples</strong> (please send me more - I am keen to learn!) - Public data released around <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/dataset/quarterly_epidemiological_commentary/resource/702302fa-131d-4405-ba67-6ab354e1762d\">MRSA</a> has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/sites/default/files/ODI%20Business%20Plan%20-%20May%20Release.pdf\">contributed</a> to reducing death rates - Company data released around <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://discover.amee.com/categories/CDP_emissions_and_financial_metrics\">environmental data</a> has helped to catalyse the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cdproject.net\">transition</a> to more energy efficient operations - And even remarkable stories involving <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://artisopensource.net/cure/\">individual data</a> could help to find new cures&hellip;</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Gavin Starks","slug":"gavin-starks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks","tag_ids":["board","executive","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Gavin Starks","slug":"gavin-starks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks","tag_ids":["board","executive","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/one-year-of-odi-training.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/one-year-of-odi-training","slug":"one-year-of-odi-training","title":"One year of ODI Training","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:09+01:00","created_at":"2014-04-11T09:22:00+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"As senior trainer at the ODI, would it be wrong for me to say it feels like more than a year?

As someone who has campaigned tirelessly for open postcodes, and, in my previous role at a local authority, who is only too aware of the issues surrounding licensing of geodata, this is something I&rsquo;m passionate about too.</p>\n\n<p>However, all the talk recently has been around making the Postcode Address File (PAF) public, which, given that the Royal Mail is about to be privatised, I can understand.</p>\n\n<p>That said, after a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/pipermail/developers-public/2013-February/008339.html\">discussion on the My Society mailing list</a>, I&rsquo;ve heard directly from the people who have used the PAF and their experiences haven&rsquo;t been good. The data quality is inconsistent and it&rsquo;s not maintained very well. I suspect. If this data is opened up, there may not be an argument for a privatised Royal Mail to continue maintaining it.</p>\n\n<p>There is, however, a third way. The UK already has a super-accurate, up-to-date and well maintained database of address data. It&rsquo;s managed by local authorities as part of their day-to-day activities, and regularly updated.</p>\n\n<p>That database is the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nlpg.org.uk/nlpg/welcome.htm\">National Land and Property Gazeteer</a> (NLPG). It is managed centrally by GeoPlace, a public sector partnership between the Local Government Association and Ordnance Survey. When local authorities collect data about a new property, they enter it into their databases in an agreed standard. This local data is then submitted to GeoPlace and entered into the national gazeteer.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, every property in this database is given a unique idenfier, known as a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN), which, if this data were opened up, gives us great scope for linking datasets together and giving every single property its own URI.</p>\n\n<p>This would have the benefit that when two datasets are talking about (for example) 123 High Street, Anytown, we&rsquo;re definitely talking about the same property.</p>\n\n<p>If we could open up this data, not only would we have a reliable, well-maintained source of address data, we would also have a key piece in the jigsaw of getting truly linked geographical data.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Stuart Harrison","slug":"stuart-harrison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-harrison","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Stuart Harrison","slug":"stuart-harrison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-harrison","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/open-addresses-discovery-phase.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-addresses-discovery-phase","slug":"open-addresses-discovery-phase","title":"Open Addresses: Discovery Phase","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:57+01:00","created_at":"2014-06-28T21:31:33+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Geospatial data underpins practically everything, because everything happens somewhere.

A lot of things happen somewhere with an address: our schools, hospitals, museums, supermarkets, places of work, homes. So address data \u2014 data about what addresses exist and where they are \u2014 is an essential underpinning for our national information infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>The use and utility of open data in the UK has been limited by the fact that a lot of geospatial information, and in particular data about addresses, is closed. It is only available to restricted sets of people (mostly those who can pay) and for restricted purposes. So it can\u2019t be used freely to create new, innovative products and services or simply to help everyone work more effectively by using the right addresses.</p>\n\n<p>None of the attempts to unlock existing sources of address data in the UK have been successful. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.poweredbypaf.com/end-user/products/data-products/paf-raw-data/\">Postcode Address File (PAF)</a> is maintained by the Royal Mail, and while it is feasible for a private company to open up data in the public interest, if Royal Mail were going to do so, it probably would have done so by now. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nlpg.org.uk/nlpg/welcome.htm\">National Land and Property Gazetteer</a>, available within the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/addressbase-products.html\">AddressBase suite of products</a> from Ordnance Survey, contains data from the PAF and therefore cannot be opened while PAF remains closed.</p>\n\n<p>The recent Katalysis report, commissioned by BIS, on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/an-open-national-address-gazetteer\">an Open National Address Gazetteer</a> says (my emphasis):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>UK society relies heavily on address data and current products have helped greatly to create benefit. The review has determined that Open usage would result in substantial and valuable growth among new user types and with even greater community benefit. <strong>The recommendation is that a basic address product should be free to all users at the point of use.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It\u2019s time for us to build an Open Address Database together.</p>\n\n<p>The success of OpenStreetMap has demonstrated what a community can do when it works together to create a common good. We need to replicate that success around what is, in some ways, a much smaller problem: a database of addresses. As Steven Feldman said in his blog post <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/enough-of-this-ab-paf-i-need-an-oaf/\">Enough of this AB PAF, I need an OAF</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If we can\u2019t make PAF open, surely we have the skills and raw data to start building an Open Address File? If we worked smart with the Open Data that is available, added in what we already have in OpenStreetMap and did some smart conflation and interpolation we would be on our way to creating an Open Address File. It would be patchy to start with but once we had a framework we could find ways to fill in the gaps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the great thing is that the Open Data User Group and the Public Sector Transparency Board, both run out of the Cabinet Office, agree, to the extent that <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/blog/funding-agreed-important-new-open-data-projects\">they have funded ODI</a> to, in the first instance, look at the feasibility of developing an Open Address Database.</p>\n\n<p>The initial Discovery phase, which is all that\u2019s been funded thus far, and will probably run through the summer, has three general aims:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>To understand the data that\u2019s available, its coverage, and how the database can be structured such that we can trace back its origin to open sources or individual entry to demonstrate the data hasn\u2019t come from PAF and therefore isn\u2019t subject to Royal Mail\u2019s IP rights.</li>\n  <li>To scope out and understand the governance framework and business models that could be adopted by such an enterprise, to ensure that it\u2019s sustainable in the long term.</li>\n  <li>To engage potential users, providers and developers to understand their desires and requirements, so that whatever is built is useful.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We\u2019d love to know what you think.

I wanted to highlight a few that are particularly important within the UK.</p>\n\n<h3>Corporate Information</h3>\n\n<p>Thursday saw the release of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/library/open-government-partnership-uk-national-action-plan-2013-2015\">UK&rsquo;s National Action Plan</a>. This includes, as announced by David Cameron, a commitment to publicly publish a register of beneficial ownership, ie information about who owns which companies. There is still some detail to be worked out about this commitment. As <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.opencorporates.com/2013/10/31/british-pm-gets-it-good-business-requires-good-open-data/\">Chris Taggart has argued</a>, this information must be published not just publicly but as open data if it is to achieve its potential impact. The same arguments that I made around the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/lobbyist-register-should-be-open-data\">publication of the Lobbyist Register</a> apply to a register of beneficial ownership.</p>\n\n<p>Friday saw the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/pressDesk/news/freeAccountsData.shtml\">release by Companies House of accounts data</a> as open data. This is another amazingly rich source of information about how companies are working. This is important for corporate transparency, but it will be interesting to see how other organisations might analyse this data, as it provides a picture of the state of the UK economy at a very granular level.</p>\n\n<p>What we are gradually seeing with corporate information is an accretion of datasets that can be linked together, through the company registration number, to provide greater insight into how individual companies and the economy as a whole are working. This includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>contracts information such as in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://online.contractsfinder.businesslink.gov.uk/\">Contracts Finder</a>, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ted.europa.eu/TED/main/HomePage.do\">European collection of tenders, Ted</a>, and more widely published under the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.open-contracting.org/\">Open Contracting</a> initiative</li>\n  <li>spending data published by central government and local councils that includes information about payments to companies, brought together within efforts such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://openspending.org/\">OpenSpending</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://openlylocal.com/\">OpenlyLocal</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.spendnetwork.com/\">Spend Network</a></li>\n  <li>grant and funding information such as that published through <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\">IATI</a>, by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/research/open-data\">BIG Lottery</a>, or from TSB (watch this space)</li>\n  <li>insolvency information published as data through <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.thegazette.co.uk/\">The Gazette</a> (currently in beta)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the UK, we are reaching a critical mass of open data about corporate activity. If large financial institutions aren&rsquo;t making use of it, they are missing a trick.</p>\n\n<h3>UK National Action Plan</h3>\n\n<p>Open data is a cornerstone of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/open-government-partnership-uk-national-action-plan-2013/open-government-partnership-uk-national-action-plan-2013-to-2015#open-data-radically-opening-up-government-data-for-greater-accountability-public-service-improvement-and-economic-growth\">UK&rsquo;s Open Government Partnership National Action Plan</a> for the next two years. There are five commitments explicitly within the &ldquo;Open Data&rdquo; section, but many others focus on publishing more and better open data, including through <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/\">legislation.gov.uk</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/\">OpenDataCommunities</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As Jonathan Grey from OKFN points out, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2013/11/05/open-government-should-be-about-accountability-and-social-justice-not-the-digital-economy/\">open government is about accountability and social justice</a>. Open data can help to achieve that accountability, but it is also helpful for supporting economic growth and improving public services. Embedding broader open data commitments within the Open Government Partnership plan is not a perfect fit, but expedient.</p>\n\n<p>The Commitment 3 focuses on local authority data:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The UK government will issue a revised Local Authorities Data Transparency Code requiring local authorities to publish key information and data. This will place more power into citizens\u2019 hands and make it easier for local people to contribute to the local decision making process and help shape public services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Particularly welcome here is the commitment to &ldquo;bring into force regulations making it a legal requirement for local authorities to publish data in accordance with the Code&rdquo;, this winter. At ODI, we have argued for some time that sustainable open data publication is crucial for businesses, large and small, who want to build products and services over open data. Legislation is a powerful way in which government can guarantee that supply.</p>\n\n<p>It remains to be seen exactly which datasets will be included within the new Code of Practice; the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/improving-local-government-transparency\">consultation on Improving local government transparency</a> ran almost a year ago and a response is promised this month.</p>\n\n<h3>National Information Infrastructure</h3>\n\n<p>A report on the ongoing development of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-information-infrastructure\">UK&rsquo;s National Information Infrastructure</a> (NII) was also published last week. It&rsquo;s now possible to filter the 14,000+ datasets listed on data.gov.uk down to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/data/search?core_dataset=true\">280 which are classified as NII</a>. Of these, over a quarter aren&rsquo;t published, many because they include personal data (and thus couldn&rsquo;t be released without anonymisation) or are subject to IP restrictions. But where the data can be published, the NII acts as a useful way of focusing attention on important datasets.</p>\n\n<p>At ODI we are particularly pleased to see the action:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Action: Departments should put all their datasets currently available under an Open Government Licence through the ODI\u2019s open data certification process, giving priority to the datasets included in the NII, and make the outcome available through data.gov.uk, by December 2014.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our ideal is for NII datasets to be published at the Expert level of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificates</a>, but our experience is that even answering the questions posed by the Open Data Certificates helps publishers to identify quick and easy ways in which they can improve their open data publication. We have already implemented functionality that automatically completes much of the questionnaire based on metadata published on data.gov.uk, and look forward to data.gov.uk displaying the level of certification for those datasets that have gone through the process.</p>\n\n<h3>Open Data Index and Barometer</h3>\n\n<p>The final set of announcements from last week that I want to draw attention to here are the announcement of the Open Knowledge Foundation&rsquo;s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://index.okfn.org/\">Open Data Index 2013</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opendatabarometer.org\">Open Data Barometer 2013</a> which was developed by the Web Foundation in collaboration with us here at ODI. (<a href=\"/team/dave-tarrant\">Dave Tarrant</a> has done a great <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.github.io/open-data-barometer-viz/\">interactive visualisation</a> if you want to explore the Barometer results.)</p>\n\n<p>These are both useful ways of measuring how well countries are doing at opening up data, with slightly different emphases. The Open Data Index focuses on the availability of particular important datasets. The Open Data Barometer assesses readiness (such as policy context), implementation and impacts, offering a measure of how far the publication of open data is affecting business and society as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>The UK rightly tops both of the measures, thanks to all the advocates and practitioners of open data both within and outside government. But it is still possible to lead the world in these measures <em>and</em> have a long way to go. As the Barometer highlights, the UK has done well at providing an environment friendly to open data, and at releasing some important data sets, but it is yet to realise the full benefits, particularly in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>increasing government efficiency and effectiveness</li>\n  <li>increasing environmental sustainability</li>\n  <li>increasing the inclusion of marginalised groups in policy making and accessing public services</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s my hope that we can work on creating impact in these areas at ODI over the next year.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-certificates-beta.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-data-certificates-beta","slug":"open-data-certificates-beta","title":"Open Data Certificates Beta","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:46+01:00","created_at":"2013-06-14T13:13:34+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"For a few months now we have been working on a new tool that we hope will help improve the way in which people publish their open data.

Today we&rsquo;re proud to announce the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://certificate.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificates website</a> beta.</p>\n\n<p>The certificates, which are generated for free, give data publishers a way to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>show how well they are publishing open data</li>\n  <li>identify and prioritise areas that they could improve</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are three things that I wanted to highlight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First</strong>, if you have published open data <em>at all</em> you&rsquo;ve already achieved something. Even publishing a spreadsheet under an open licence can mean making a case to Management, battling with Legal and cajoling IT. At its most basic \u2014 Raw level \u2014 an Open Data Certificate shows you are publishing accessible data under an open licence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, the Open Data Certificate looks at the whole context of data publishing, not just licences and data formats. In framing the questions and working out the levels, we have taken the perspective of someone who wants to use the data you are publishing.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What would it take,&rdquo; we ask, &ldquo;to invest time, energy and money in building something with this data?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The answer is, &ldquo;quite a lot&rdquo;. Raw data releases in poor formats with few guarantees and little support are fine for experimenting with during hackdays, but entrepreneurs and existing organisations need a more reliable data supply. That doesn&rsquo;t mean raw data is bad \u2014 far from it, it&rsquo;s through these experimental releases that publishers can learn what people need from them \u2014 only that it is the start of a journey, not an end.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, the highest bar \u2014 the Expert level of the certificate \u2014 is really (no, <em>really</em>) high. The Expert level is what we expect from data that forms the core information infrastructure for a country. It marks a level of reliability, quality of provision and support that is important for data that underpins multitudes of services and decisions.</p>\n\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know of any services that could gain an Expert certificate at the moment. We hope that the certificate will push the open data services that are already good to address the areas they&rsquo;ve been neglecting. We don&rsquo;t know which will be the first to achieve an Expert certificate, but it will be a cause for celebration when they do.</p>\n\n<p>But not all open data needs to be that good: publishers need to choose for themselves whether and where to invest resources to improve how they make open data available.</p>\n\n<p>To finish, I wanted to thank all those who have contributed to the development of the Open Data Certificates thus far: all the people who have <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-certificate/issues\">raised issues on GitHub</a>, emailed with questions and suggestions, helped with our user testing, and offered support.

We hope that people will engage in the discussion to help drive the open agenda.</p>\n\n<p>There is a genuine and timely opportunity to take a leadership position, and commit to unlocking data to help stimulate economic growth and social equity.</p>\n\n<p>Delegates will also hear from three start-up companies about the value of open data \u2013 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/case-study/mastodon-c\">Mastodon C</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.carbonculture.net/\">Carbon Culture</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/guest-blog-honest-buildings-joins-odi-start-ups\">Honest Buildings</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Started in April 2012, Mastodon C helps businesses run a customisable big data platform on zero carbon cloud infrastructure, as well as helping their clients unlock the power of their data through advanced analytics advice and development.</p>\n\n<p>Francine Bennett, founder of Mastodon C says: \u201cThe value of open data for start-ups like Mastodon C can\u2019t be underestimated. It\u2019s simple, without the access we have today, we wouldn\u2019t be able to operate. By bringing together public data sets that are available, social media data and data sets that clients already have, we can help improve clients businesses and in turn, use data to improve their profits.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>CarbonCulture is digital service that helps businesses turn sustainability leadership into great communications, staff engagement and direct energy savings - delivering value for businesses and their communities.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Open data is set to transform the way all businesses operate, and sustainability provides a good example of the benefits. CarbonCulture members use open data to reduce their direct costs, demonstrate their leadership to others. And they share the benefits among a community of leaders like Number 10 Downing St, DECC and Defra. Few successful businesses compete with others on their energy efficiency, and every business wants to help mitigate climate change. For smart businesses, sharing leadership on sustainability is a great way of engaging their people, driving their business and cutting costs at the same time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Also today, the ODI <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/news/odi-welcomes-information-economy-strategy-%E2%80%93-launched-g8-innovation-conference\">has responded</a> to the UK Government&rsquo;s\u0002Information Economy Strategy, being officially launched at today&rsquo;s G8 Innovation Conference.</p>\n\n<p>The Prime\u0002Minister\u0002made open data one of the themes of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBDjX7-y_Ak&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m42s\">his closing remarks</a> at the Innovation Conference - highlighting the role of the ODI.</p>\n\n<p>\u0002</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/odi-website-launched.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/odi-website-launched","slug":"odi-website-launched","title":"Open Data Institute Website Launched","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:39:58+01:00","created_at":"2012-09-05T14:56:43+01:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"With the launch of the Open Data Institute only months away, a website has been launched to entice new members to join the upcoming global leading centre in Open Data.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p>With the launch of the Open Data Institute only months away, a website has been launched to entice new members to join the upcoming global leading centre in Open Data.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-institute-appoints-stuart-coleman-commercial-director.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/open-data-institute-appoints-stuart-coleman-commercial-director","slug":"open-data-institute-appoints-stuart-coleman-commercial-director","title":"Open Data Institute appoints Stuart Coleman as Commercial Director","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:27+01:00","created_at":"2012-09-25T10:05:25+01:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The Open Data Institute has announced that Stuart Coleman will be its Commercial Director, taking up the post on on 1st October.

This is personal and sensitive data, and quite rightly the Department for Education has stringent controls and limitations around who can access the individual-level data. They control what parts of the database others can get hold of and how it can be used. Those who want access have to apply, and if the application fails they can\u2019t have it.</p>\n\n<p>So the National Pupil Database is not open data.</p>\n\n<p>But when the National Pupil Database was first <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/dataset/national-pupil-database\">entered in data.gov.uk</a>, it was incorrectly described as open data and licensed under the Open Government Licence. The National Pupil Database also appears within the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.data.gov.uk/sites/default/files/DfE%20Open%20Data%20Strategy_0.pdf\">Department for Education\u2019s Open Data Strategy</a> document as being available under the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/\">Open Government Licence</a>. This is misleading and potentially damaging; as we argue in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/consultation-response/proposed-amendments-individual-pupil-information-prescribed-persons\">our response to the Department for Education\u2019s consultation</a>, access to the National Pupil Database should be tightly restricted.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Department for Education does make available a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/download_data.html\">wide range of useful aggregations</a> based on analysis of the data within the National Pupil Database. There is no need to apply to get hold of the aggregated data, you can just download them from the Department for Education website. This <em>is</em> open data, and three-star at that!</p>\n\n<p>To their credit, the Department for Education have corrected some of these errors, but their original confusion highlights the need for us to describe more clearly what open data means and how and when to use it. Doing this is a fundamental part of our mission at the Open Data Institute.</p>\n\n<p><em>Thanks to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EinsteinsAttic\">Phil Booth</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/owenboswarva\">Owen Boswarva</a> for their pointers contributing to this post.</em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/open-workflows-open-teams.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/open-workflows-open-teams","slug":"open-workflows-open-teams","title":"Open Workflows for Open Teams (and closed ones too)","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:29+01:00","created_at":"2013-03-04T08:24:11+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"It\u2019s been six weeks since I joined the ODI, and so far, the most interesting thing about working herehas been the approach we take to software development.

We&rsquo;re only two sprints in, so we&rsquo;re still iterating this\u0002but it&rsquo;s working nicely so far.</p>\n\n<p>When we started, we spent a while thinking about how we wanted to work, with a few aims in mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>we are a collective</li>\n  <li>we are transparent</li>\n  <li>processes must be low-impact</li>\n  <li>use the simplest tools we can</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We are, of course, working in an agile fashion, following some elements of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)\">scrum</a>, but as is proper for an agile process, we are also adapting it to our needs. Scrum too often turns into agile-for-people-who-like-waterfall, which defeats the whole object.</p>\n\n<h2>Collective ownership</h2>\n\n<p>Tasks are not assigned up front, they are chosen by the team members. We also collectively agree on what we can achieve during a 2-week sprint.\u0002\nThe code itself is also collectively owned;* &ldquo;Oh, X wrote that, but I don&rsquo;t really know how it works&rdquo;* is a <strong>big</strong> danger sign. Instituting a rule of <em>&ldquo;you wrote that bit last sprint, so you don&rsquo;t touch it this time around&rdquo;</em> is a Very Good Thing, even if it slows you down sometimes; the long-term benefits will outweigh the temporary cost.\u0002\nWe&rsquo;ve already seen technical debt accumulate in this short time, and while making sure we deal with it quickly by spreading knowledge around the team takes time (and cost us a sprint goal or two), we&rsquo;re much better off dealing with it immediately.</p>\n\n<h2>Branch/Review/Merge</h2>\n\n<p>We love <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">Git</a>, and we love the tools that <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/\">Github</a> have built around it.</p>\n\n<p>We all sat down and watched Zach Holman&rsquo;s talk <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/\">&ldquo;How Github use Github to build Github&rdquo;</a>, and have taken a lot of inspiration from the way they do things. Once you get into your head that branching has zero cost, workflows become so smooth it&rsquo;s ridiculous.\u0002\n- Branch from master to &ldquo;feature-{issue_number}-{description}&rdquo;\n- Work for a short while (not necessarily until you&rsquo;re finished)\n- Open a pull request back to master for discussion\n- Invite ongoing review on the PR\n- Get someone else to merge back to master when complete (or earlier if safe)</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already had really positive engagement (both internally and externally) directly in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-orgn-services/pulls\">pull request</a> comments, which is just fantastic. Not having to leave your flow to communicate with clients makes a much more productive programmer.</p>\n\n<h2>Issue tracking</h2>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re also using Github for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-orgn-services/issues\">issue tracking</a> and other documentation. While the issue tracking is basic, it does 90% of what you think you need (and you don&rsquo;t actually need the other 10%). Once you have two separate fields for different types of priorities, or add time-tracking on individual issues, you&rsquo;re just introducing cruft that clutters the place up and adds admin overhead (nobody ever looks at that stuff anyway).</p>\n\n<p>It took me a while to work out how to model dependencies, but simply adding a link to the master ticket from the sub-ticket (&ldquo;this is needed for #42&rdquo;) gives a nice open/closed view in the master ticket, which works well enough. This even works across repositories, meaning that you can use a single issue tracker for a project even if it&rsquo;s split into multiple places.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/issues_0.png\" alt=\"Github issue tracker\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Learning as we go</h2>\n\n<p>Obviously, none of this is fixed in stone and\u0002for me, that&rsquo;s\u0002the single most important thing about agile development. We&rsquo;re not always living up to what we want to do, and besides, what we said we&rsquo;d do isn&rsquo;t necessarily the best way.\u0002I find myself analysing our workflow and my own performance a <strong>lot</strong>, and end up really looking forward to the retrospectives we have as part of planning for the next sprint.\u0002\nThe joy of being at the ODI is that we have a team who really understand and buy into this way of doing things. We work openly <em>internally</em> as well as externally, trying to communicate continuously with each other and with our clients. It gives\u0002us an instant shared culture, and shared victories (along with shared failures), and those are the things that will bind\u0002an excellent team together&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>(even if they do take a little more time to do things <em>right</em>\u0002sometimes)</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"James Smith","slug":"james-smith","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/james-smith","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/call-for-data-art-curators.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/call-for-data-art-curators","slug":"call-for-data-art-curators","title":"Open call for curators","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:34+01:00","created_at":"2013-09-20T17:01:32+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Data as Culture","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p><strong>Data as Culture</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 2012 the Open Data Institute published a successful open call for artists to submit data-driven artworks for display in their new premises.

UKGovCamps are an amazing opportunity for those working in the general &lsquo;digital&rsquo;\u0002arena, both within and around government to meet up and discuss their work.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s an &lsquo;unconference&rsquo;, which means that there&rsquo;s no agenda before the day itself, anyone can suggest a session, and there are many parallel sessions at any one time. I suggested a session on &lsquo;Open Data in Five Years&rsquo; Time&rsquo;, which was merged with Hadley Beeman&rsquo;s suggested session on evolving &lsquo;Open Data Communities&rsquo;. The lively discussion touched on both utopian and dystopian visions of how open data might be used in five years&rsquo; time; I&rsquo;ll try to pull out the key themes here.</p>\n\n<h2>Good outcomes</h2>\n\n<p>We first focused on the good outcomes that we want to aim towards. In five years&rsquo; time, we should be able to use real-time information to help us\u0002solve problems in an informed and interactive way. The information might come from a variety of sources: public, open data such as road networks, traffic flows and weather forecasts; data generated by the crowd such as tweets and other conversations; and data from things that we use in our lives, such as internet-connected cars, fridges and thermostats.</p>\n\n<p>Government in particular will benefit from having a greater understanding of how to target services, by making better use of the information that it already has, but that rarely crosses authority boundaries. This is part of a general theme around different organisations within government being able to pick up and use information from each other to inform their decisions.</p>\n\n<p>The promise is that data will be so integral to the services and products that we use that we won&rsquo;t think about &ldquo;open data&rdquo; as an end in itself. Instead, our focus will be on the problems that we want to solve, with open data being one of the means to those ends.</p>\n\n<p>In this utopian vision, the general population is better informed both because they are better able to get hold of the data they need to answer their questions, and because they have an improved data literacy that enables them to understand that data. A knock-on effect of this is that a better-informed populace is better able to engage in (political) debates about how to address the challenges we face as a society.</p>\n\n<h2>What might stand in our way</h2>\n\n<p>An alternative outcome is that, while information is generally available for everyone, only some communities are able to use it. We could see a data divide between those who know how to analyse and visualise data to their advantage, and those who do not.</p>\n\n<p>Equally, as policy shifts towards making data available, we may find unanticipated, and negative consequences arising from the additional transparency. An example recently has been that the additional data being made available about\u0002spending on Government Procurement Cards has contributed to departments not using them, leading to government procuring products and services through other, non-transparent, channels.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that, while recognising the utility of data, organisations seek to monetise it by restricting access rather than making it openly available for reuse. Just as we see subscription-based models for accessing content on the web, we may find organisations keeping their data behind pay-walls.</p>\n\n<p>We might also see &lsquo;open data lite&rsquo;: data that is <em>accessible</em> to everyone, even in machine-readable form, but is not published under an open data licence and therefore cannot be reused in flexible ways. A current example might be <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/125226.aspx\">flood alerts from the Environment Agency</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What we should do</h2>\n\n<p>One theme that emerged was around the power of procurement in shaping whether and how open data is made available. Public authorities can shape the market by selecting suppliers whose products automatically produce open data.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, as we see more public-sector services being out-sourced to the private sector, getting open data back from these suppliers becomes an effective mechanism for monitoring their performance, and the contractual relationship between the local authority and the supplier provides an effective lever for ensuring they produce open data.</p>\n\n<p>We discussed embedding requirements for open data into Requests For Proposals, and how this is easier now within government because there is defined terminology for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78892/Open-Standards-Principles-FINAL.pdf\">open standards</a>. Government needs to be a better informed and empowered customer, so that it can say &lsquo;yes, you can open that data&rsquo;\u0002to reluctant\u0002incumbents and prospective providers. Government also needs to involve stakeholders in framing what open data should be made available.</p>\n\n<p>In many cases, public authorities and citizens don&rsquo;t have the expertise to analyse the data that they have or can get hold of. We discussed the choice between building skills and building tools. This reflected a later session that was specifically about helping those in the community to get the best out of the data that was available. There are a range of options, and it&rsquo;s likely that <em>all</em> of them will have their place:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>data literacy training as part of a citizenship curriculum</li>\n  <li>easy-to-use generic visualisation tools (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.openheatmap.com/\">Open Heat Map</a> was recommended)</li>\n  <li>specialist tools designed for viewing particular data</li>\n  <li>external organisations providing analysis and visualisation services</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The final theme was about the power of case studies that demonstrate a focus on particular problems, in which open data is simply one of a range of techniques employed to achieve those goals. These case studies need to be honest in describing what can be done, including describing how hard the process can be, both at a technical and a cultural level. Without this honesty, organisations who open up data may become disheartened when they find it is not easy. To be convincing, case studies also need to be deep, and to stand up to scrutiny from sceptics as well as believers.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>My main reflection on this session, and indeed the rest of the day at UKGovCamp, was that the discussions around open data are becoming deeper and richer. There was a focus on impact \u2014 on employing open data as a tool to achieve a particular goal \u2014 and a focus on how we make open data truly for everyone, so that its benefits are felt outside the data geek circles. These themes resonate with the Open Data Institute&rsquo;s mission.</p>\n\n<p><em>Many thanks to Dave, Steph, and the rest of the UKGovCamp 2013 team for making the day so enjoyable and worthwhile.</em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/open-data-season-underway-odi-attends-us-conferences.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/open-data-season-underway-odi-attends-us-conferences","slug":"open-data-season-underway-odi-attends-us-conferences","title":"Open data season underway as ODI attends US conferences","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:02+01:00","created_at":"2013-09-09T14:02:47+01:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The ODI joins world-leading experts at two US conferences this week - with open data and government transparency at their heart.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p>The ODI joins world-leading experts at two US conferences this week - with open data and government transparency at their heart.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.datatransparency2013.com/\">Data Transparency 2013</a> takes place in Washington DC on Tuesday 10th September and is the country\u2019s first federal open data policy conference.

Combined with aggressive statements about tracking down tax avoidance, we could see the coming together of objectives with material impact using open data as the instrument of change.</p>\n\n<p>The big questions to me are: is it rhetoric that will lead to the release of benign data, or will it catalyse real change?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/standard%2Dcert.png\" alt=\"Open Data Certificates\" />### <strong><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://certificates.theODI.org\">http://certificates.theODI.org</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>I presented the ODI\u2019s new <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://certificates.theodi.org\">Open Data Certificates</a> at the Summit as the first robust badge for publishing open data. We believe the it is a tangible way to measure some of the commitments in the Charter.</p>\n\n<p>The rhetoric at the Summit was very aligned with our perspective at the ODI: that we face unprecedented challenges as a society: a scaling population, our environmental security, our economic stability and growth. These are issues unique to our time. I believe that;</p>\n\n<p><em>Open data is an enabler of freedom: to trade, to learn, to be secure, <br />\nto our well-being as individuals, organisations, and as countries.</em></p>\n\n<p>Much as the web of open documents has catalysed innovation around the world over the last 20 years, the web of open data will help us address local and global challenges. Open data helps us tackle these issues at scale: fostering collaboration, connecting information, and providing transparency.</p>\n\n<p><em>As we unlock the data we can tell the story of how *<br />\n*open information, transformed into insight, changes the world.</em></p>\n\n<p>I have watched the evolution of open data culture over the past 20 years: from grassroots initiatives, to innovative groups like <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mysociety.org/\">MySociety</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://okfn.org/\">OKF</a>, to the creation last year of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org\">ODI</a>. Seeing the G8 sign the first <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter/\">Open Data Charter</a> this week, leads me to think we are seeing a coming of age of open data:</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201ca new era in which people can use open data to generate <br />\n insights, ideas, and services to create a better world for all.\u201d <br />\n[G8 Open Data Charter]</em></p>\n\n<p>I am reminded of the words of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.oblomovka.com/\">Danny O\u2019Brien</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mysociety.org/about-tom-steinberg/\">Tom Steinberg</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://tom.loosemore.com/\">Tom Loosemore</a> in their <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/govt-broken-citizen-scrutiny-bugfix\">descriptions</a> of how to fix government:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Identify broken civic institution</li>\n  <li>Liberate data from said institution</li>\n  <li>Build civic tool too useful to turn off</li>\n  <li>Leave for X years</li>\n  <li>Watch institution adapt</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Getting open data anywhere near the agenda of the G8 in less than one lifetime seems, therefore, a minor miracle. It is also a reflection of the pace of change that is now possible, and one that will accelerate in our \u2018always connected\u2019, increasingly data literate society.</p>\n\n<p>We need to be aware of the road ahead. While the rhetoric on open is clear, realising impact in any material way will be a difficult journey.</p>\n\n<p><em>By making open data integral to their approach, the G8 can address its objectives on <br />\neconomic growth, tax, transparency, trade, and commitments on land and extractives.</em></p>\n\n<p>In the UK, where we claim some leadership, we have found it impossible to release critical open data assets, such as the country\u2019s legal addresses, or the boundary data relating to land titles, or basic environmental data such as national flood data.</p>\n\n<p>This does not send a positive signal to anyone that our ambitions match reality. We need to work together on addressing the blockers: understanding people\u2019s concerns, providing training, transforming commercial models, enabling people to innovate, and taking risks.</p>\n\n<p><em>Transformation never comes without disruption.</em><br />\n<em>So, disruption is also the new normal.</em></p>\n\n<p>We need strong leadership, not just from politicians, but from the commercial sector, academia, and the third sector. Failure to engage in this new normal introduces risk to your organisation. Creative engagement will help open up models for both transition and innovation.</p>\n\n<p>The right frameworks, processes, tools will help but , above all else, by investing in people we can engage with each other, with citizens, organisations and governments to deliver powerful insights that enable change. If we believe there is gold, we need miners.</p>\n\n<p>I am reminded of the impact of the Millennium Development Goals:</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe Millennium Development Goals have proven that</em><br />\n<em>focused global development objectives can make a profound difference\u201d</em><br />\n[<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.unric.org/en/latest-un-buzz/28597-big-strides-on-millennium-development-goals-with-more-targets-achievable-by-2015-un-report\">UNRIC</a>]</p>\n\n<p>Enabling a global network of experts to help us catalyse challenge is at the heart of the ODI\u2019s agenda, and the whole team here is genuinely excited to be part of it. We look forward to meeting you.</p>\n\n<p>This is [still] the beginning of the journey.</p>\n\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n\n<p>Open Data is good for America [Todd Park and Steven VanRoekel]<br />\n[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-vanroekel/open-data-is-good-for-ame_b<em>3354451.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-vanroekel/open-data-is-good-for-ame_b</em>3354451.html)</p>\n\n<p>Why we should welcome a G8 Open Data Charter [Martin Tisne]<br />\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10125211/Why-we-should-welcome-a-G8-Open-Data-Charter.html\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10125211/Why-we-should-welcome-a-G8-Open-Data-Charter.html</a></p>\n\n<p>G8 Open Data Charter: why it matters [Nigel Shadbolt]<br />\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/g8/10128266/G8-Open-Data-Charter-why-it-matters.html\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/g8/10128266/G8-Open-Data-Charter-why-it-matters.html</a></p>\n\n<p>G8 Open Data Charter Highlights Open Data as Crucial for Governance and Growth [Rufus Pollock]<br />\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2013/06/18/g8-highlights-open-data-as-crucial-for-governance-and-growth/\">http://blog.okfn.org/2013/06/18/g8-highlights-open-data-as-crucial-for-governance-and-growth/</a></p>\n\n<p>The Independent<br />\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/g8-open-data-charter-will-increase-transparency-and-fuel-innovation-8665696.html\">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/g8-open-data-charter-will-increase-transparency-and-fuel-innovation-8665696.html</a></p>\n\n<p>TechWorld<br />\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blogs.techworld.com/incubator/2013/06/g8-commitment-to-open-data-is-good-news-for-entrepreneurs/index.htm\">http://blogs.techworld.com/incubator/2013/06/g8-commitment-to-open-data-is-good-news-for-entrepreneurs/index.htm</a></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Gavin Starks","slug":"gavin-starks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks","tag_ids":["board","executive","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Gavin Starks","slug":"gavin-starks","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/gavin-starks","tag_ids":["board","executive","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/ordnance-surveys-geovation-challenge.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/ordnance-surveys-geovation-challenge","slug":"ordnance-surveys-geovation-challenge","title":"Ordnance Survey\u2019s open data GeoVation Challenge ","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:32+01:00","created_at":"2013-12-19T11:30:59+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"Would you like to submit an idea to Ordnance Survey\u2019s GeoVation Challenge to encourage active lifestyles in Britain?

This is proof-positive that open is becoming the new normal and we are one step closer to creating a web of data alongside the web of documents that is integral to all our lives. I would urge the world\u2019s largest companies to show leadership in the corporate sector by presenting their information as open data so that we can get access to a \u0002truly transparent view of the world\u2019s corporate networks\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Starks and ODI Chairman, Sir Nigel Shadbolt are currently in Aspen, Colorado, taking part in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://new.livestream.com/aspeninstitute/Focas2013\">Aspen Institute\u2019s Forum on Communications and Society </a>(FOCAS 2013). 35 influential academics, government representatives and public policy experts will discuss transparency tools and approaches to improving the way governments and citizens interact.</p>\n\n<p>Nigel Shadbolt said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIdentifying the extensive, complex, and sometimes opaque connections which exist amongst global corporations is of enormous benefit to society and the economy. By opening up this data, OpenCorporates provide tools that promote transparency, accountability and efficient governance. Companies who believe in ethical trading and honest markets have nothing to fear and much to gain from open data. Understanding their networks will enable governments, businesses and citizens to make better decisions \u2013 be they legislative, commercial, ethical or environmental. The tide has already turned towards openness, those who do not turn with it will be left behind.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the corporate network visualisations, OpenCorporates has produced <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opencorporates.com/viz/financial/index.html\">maps </a>which show the world-wide interests of four US banks - Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. They reveal complex and deep networks, as well as the central position that the Cayman Islands have within the networks.</p>\n\n<p>OpenCorporates hopes the project will encourage companies to improve the accuracy of their reporting and make more information available as open data. \u0002Chief Executive, Chris Taggart said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOpenCorporates new corporate network feature allows everyone access to global corporate networks on the same free and open basis, massively reducing barriers to access this data. It also allows collaboration between data holders, and the wider community to show gaps, errors and inconsistencies in official data.

They focused on a class of drugs called statins, which are used to prevent cardiovascular problems.  </p>\n\n<p>The current evidence shows that for most patients, all drugs from this class are equally safe and effective, so doctors are usually advised to use the cheapest. The analysis examined how much money was spent in each area on the more expensive drugs. It looks at the entire prescriptions dataset (37 million rows of data), and therefore represents results from facts, not models. If the research had been conducted a year ago, over \u00a3200m could have been saved, looking forward the team expect to identify similar potential savings.  </p>\n\n<p>It found that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>An average \u00a327m a month of potentially unnecessary expenditure on the two proprietary statins took place last year in the NHS in England.</li>\n  <li>This is part of a wider issue of spending on proprietary drugs in cases where good and far cheaper generic equivalents exist. Previous research has estimated that these wider patterns cost the NHS over \u00a31 billion pounds a year in excess spend*.</li>\n  <li>The cost of an individual prescription item can vary from as little as 81p for a generic, to over \u00a320 for drugs still under licence to the pharmaceutical companies that develop\u0002- The set of available drugs is constantly evolving, and the right prescription for each individual is very personal. The analysis doesn&rsquo;t suggest that all the prescribing costs identified\u0002are \u201cwaste\u201d but a clear public overview of the data can make it easier for doctors, patients, politicians, the NHS and the public to identify potential savings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The initial data analysis is available through a new online portal called<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.prescribinganalytics.com/\"> Prescribing Analytics</a>, which is open to everyone - but particularly to support health care professionals and managers with responsibility for prescribing drugs and controlling budgets.  </p>\n\n<p>Ben Goldacre, the doctor and writer behind <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.badscience.net/\">BadScience.net</a> said:  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have found potentially huge savings for the NHS here, in a project that cost almost nothing to build, by doing one simple analysis on publicly available data. I\u2019m sure doctors and patients will find it useful to see whether they can save NHS money in their area. But the real joy has been working on a project with that combined the skills of geeks and geeky doctors: I hope others will come and do the same!\u201d  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Open data value</strong></p>\n\n<p>Welcoming the findings, Medical Director of the NHS Commissioning Board, Sir Bruce Keogh said:  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cVariation in prescribing habits costs the NHS millions of pounds a year. Transparent sharing of information will help clinicians understand whether they are over or under prescribing. This will focus minds in a way that will not only improve the quality of treatment for patients but also reduce cost and free up money for re-investment in other parts of the NHS.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>The ODI\u2019s Chairman, Nigel Shadbolt said:  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis project is an example of how open data can be used to help services run more effectively and efficiently. In using open data to highlight trends, we see where we can do better and make improvements. Inefficiency in any system often results from poor or incomplete information about the overall picture. This is something that open data can address as Prescribing Analytics so dramatically illustrates. The analysis should be required reading for all GPs as they seek to make best use of their resources\u201d.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>One of the drugs in this first phase of work, Atorvastatin, has now come off licence. However, the team working on Prescribing Analytics have identified several more drug categories that they plan to analyse.  </p>\n\n<p>The ODI has provided business advice and financial support to the team behind the findings. CEO, Gavin Starks said:  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is an exceptional example of Open Data being transformed into knowledge for everyone. It gives patients and GPs the tools they need to help realise big savings for the NHS - which is ultimately value for everyone.  </p>\n\n<p>The team have done an excellent job designing programmes that make it easy for anyone to use the information to maximise its impact. They have shown an important element of the power of Open Data- raising awareness and helping everyone create interventions that drive change.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>Read\u0002this story in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21567980-how-scrutiny-freely-available-data-might-save-nhs-money-beggar-thy-neighbour\">The Economist</a></em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/preserving-data-for-future-generations.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/preserving-data-for-future-generations","slug":"preserving-data-for-future-generations","title":"Preserving data for future generations","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:16+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-31T09:07:51+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/culture.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/culture","slug":"culture","title":"Data as Culture","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:46+01:00","created_at":"2012-11-25T22:02:06+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/data-culture-recession-crisps-fuel-odi-staff.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/data-culture-recession-crisps-fuel-odi-staff","slug":"data-culture-recession-crisps-fuel-odi-staff","title":"Data as Culture: Recession Crisps Fuel ODI Staff","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:21+01:00","created_at":"2013-01-14T16:11:31+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"]}],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"UK\u2019s only copy of the Skor Codex Presented to ODI President, Sir Tim Berners-Le","excerpt":"The UK\u2019s only copy of the Skor Codex presented to ODI President, Sir Tim Berners-Lee","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p><strong>The UK\u2019s only copy of the Skor Codex presented to ODI President, Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3814/10591524863_7219a96ff4.jpg\" alt=\"All rights reserved: Brendan Lea\" /></p>\n\n<p><em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.brendanlea.com/\">Image by Brendan Lea</a></em></p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/culture/skor-codex-2012\" title=\"SKOR Codex\">SKOR Codex</a>, an artwork designed as a lasting symbol of the preservation of cultural data in a non-digital format was presented to ODI Founder Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://summit.theodi.org/\" title=\"ODI Summit\">ODI Summit</a> in London on 29th October 2013 by Dutch artists, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://societeanonyme.la\" title=\"La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme\">La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The SKOR Codex is one of only eight books in existence designed to last 1000 years.

This raised more questions than it answered:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>what if there are separate licences that apply to the content and the data?</li>\n  <li>how should we reference a licence from JSON data?</li>\n  <li>how can we articulate complex attribution requirements in a machine-readable way?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We intend to start a separate piece of work that will unpack the technical issues in specifying licensing requirements for data.</p>\n\n<p>Another area that is intentionally omitted from these guides is specific advice for public sector organisations. There are additional legal constraints on how the public sector publishes its information, including that released under Freedom of Information requests. Our aim is to create a separate guide on this in conjunction with ODUG.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest addition to the drafts was around the question of attribution. Leigh Dodds has recently published a detailed analysis of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.ldodds.com/2013/04/30/how-do-we-attribute-data/\">how we attribute data</a> that highlights some of the issues that reusers can find with overly complex attribution requirements. The guide for publishers now includes advice to keep things simple.</p>\n\n<p>The hardest comments to address were the &ldquo;what if&hellip;&rdquo; questions about scraping:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;What about scraping a collection of webpages that are generated from a database that you don&rsquo;t have access to? If eg each of the rows of a SQL database table are expressed in a templated HTML web page, and someone writes a scraper that recreates the database table, have they taken a copy of the database? Or have they created their own database? Would it depend on how they got the list of pages to scrape?\u200b&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;This section talks about content and data largely separately. But one common form of republishing/derivation is taking content and turning <em>into</em> data. Scraping is the obvious case here.&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;What about publishing analyses or the results of processing data? For example, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.vosa.gov.uk/vosa/apps/recalls/default.asp\">VOSA vehicle recall stats</a> are <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.transportoffice.gov.uk/crt/doitonline/bl/help/vosatermsandconditions.htm\">protected by Crown Copyright</a>. What if I scrape and process the data and produce a list of top car manufacturers who have had prodcut recalls on matters related to brakes. Can I publish that ordered, processed list without having to go through copyright clearance?\u200b&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One of the reasons that answering these questions is hard is because there has been very little case law \u2014 judgements by the courts about what legislation means, that would help to firm up the currently fuzzy boundaries. For example, it&rsquo;s not 100% known exactly what you have to do to have a database right in the first place. Nor is it known exactly what amount of extraction or types of reutilisation are lawful.</p>\n\n<p>And this is the big reason why open data is helpful for reusers. If data is published as open data, you do not need to consult a knowledgeable lawyer about what you are doing to get the data you need, and then make a judgement about whether you&rsquo;re prepared to take the risk of a court case.</p>\n\n<p>Publishing data as open data significantly lowers the legal overhead for both publishers and reusers, leaving more resources available for everyone to get the most value out of the data itself.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/publishing-open-statistical-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/publishing-open-statistical-data","slug":"publishing-open-statistical-data","title":"Publishing Open Statistical Data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:11+01:00","created_at":"2014-04-24T10:55:18+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/5f/b8/535fb821f362be26d8000001/observation.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img\" id=\"attachment-535fb820d0d4620816000007\" /></p>\n\n<p>At <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://digitalpublishing.ons.gov.uk/2014/04/01/fresh-thinking-ons-and-the-odi/\">the request of the ONS</a>, the ODI tech team have recently been exploring some ideas around publishing statistical open data. This blog post shares some of the results of that thinking and you can also explore <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://open-statistics.herokuapp.com/\">a proof-of-concept</a> that showcases some of these ideas with real-world data.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, there are plenty of existing best practices for data publication that should be followed regardless of the type of data being published: clear licensing, availability of bulk downloads, use \nof standard, open formats, are all important. The guidance in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificate</a> questionnaire applies to all types of data, including statistics.</p>\n\n<p>But arguably there are some specific challenges that apply to the publication and re-use of statistical data. These challenges are partly due to the inherent complexity of (even simple) statistical publications. Communicating this context effectively is incredibly important in understanding and properly interpreting this type of data.</p>\n\n<p>The wide community of re-users of statistical data, each have their own distinct needs, also presents challenges: politicians, policy makers, journalists, application developers and members of the general public all need to access to official statistics at various times and in different ways.</p>\n\n<p>It is vital that statistical data is published in a way that makes it easy to locate, easy to understand, and easy to use. Statistical data needs to be immediately accessible to all users and this is as much about good user experience design as it is about ready access to bulk downloads and APIs.</p>\n\n<p>There are four key elements to what the team have been exploring so far.</p>\n\n<h2>Documentation is Vital</h2>\n\n<p>Documentation is a vital part of a statistical data release. Many statistical organisations publish analysis alongside their raw data. It is this analysis that starts to tell the initial stories around the data, drawing out the key highlights.</p>\n\n<p>But at a deeper level all aspects of the dataset need to be documented, and this information needs to be readily available in both human and machine-readable forms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What are the dimensions of the dataset? If the dimension is based on a code list or controlled vocabulary then what do the individual values mean and how do they relate to one another?</li>\n  <li>What is actually being measured?</li>\n  <li>What contextual information is required to understand individual values? For example are the numbers provisional, or are they based on limited coverage?</li>\n  <li>Is this the latest data available? When was it published? Has it been revised?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unfortunately it can often be difficult to answer these questions. Even when the raw data is available, the context required to properly interpret the data is not readily available.</p>\n\n<p>Statistical data, more than any other form of government open data, is prone to being published in carefully formatted Excel spreadsheets. The formatting is usually unnecessary, but often its there to communicate some additional context. Provisional values may be in italics. Letter codes might be added to individual data points, referencing footnotes that provide some important notes on interpreting the value. </p>\n\n<p>When we publish data to the web we can do better: We can link directly to the necessary context, in both the human and machine-readable views of the data.</p>\n\n<h2>Link All The Things</h2>\n\n<p>Every aspect of a statistical dataset should be part of the web: the dataset, its structural elements (dimensions, attributes and measures), and every individual observation should each have a unique URL.</p>\n\n<p>If observations have their own URLs then users can link to individual data points. This allows analysis to be directly linked to its supporting evidence. </p>\n\n<p>Dynamic URLs can be used to redirect to the latest figures, ensuring that people are always accessing the latest data. But the archive of individual observations can still be navigated by linking together observations collected in the previous month, quarter, or year. </p>\n\n<p>If all of the structural elements of a dataset have unique identifiers, then the definitions of terms become accessible from a single click, rather than searching through supporting notes and documentation.</p>\n\n<h2>Slicing and Dicing</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/5f/b8/535fb886f362be26d8000003/slice.png\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img text-center\" id=\"attachment-535fb8861f986a0b6a000034\" /></p>\n\n<p>There are many differents ways to slice through a statistical dataset. Comparisons can be made across different dimensions to create time-series and other charts. Rather than create a few fixed presentations, e.g. individual data tables or static charts, the data should be published via an API that supports dynamically slicing the data. This facilitates the creation of more dynamic presentations of the data: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Developers can use the API to extract the collection of data points they need, rather than downloading a\n whole dataset</li>\n  <li>Users can navigate through a dataset to generate simple visualisations, e.g. time series of some area of interest</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This can also simplify the production processes that support the creation of statistical releases allowing analysts to dynamically generate whatever charts and tables are required.</p>\n\n<h2>Embeddable Views</h2>\n\n<p>Dynamic views of the data should not be confined to the original website. The charts and data tables produced for end-users should be embeddable in other websites, allowing them to be included in news reports, blog posts, etc.</p>\n\n<p>This greatly simplifies the process of data re-use for many users. Seamless sharing of information, via linking, is an important part of how discussion happens on the web today.

Ministers are considering letting businesses apply to have access to this data, which could include personal data if a case were made by an applicant.</p>\n\n<p>In its response, the Institute says:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>It does not support the release of personally identifiable information to businesses without consent for this use from the affected individuals.</li>\n  <li>Access to the NPD shouldn&rsquo;t happen\u0002without explicit consent, as it carries an unacceptable risk of individuals being identified.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, the ODI also says there are potentially great benefits, without the same risks, in providing\u0002suitably anonymised aggregate information sourced from the NPD as open data. These could include commercial opportunities for providing services based on the data. For example, apps that help parents find homes close to schools that support the interests of their children, and to help schools to share good practices and facilities.</p>\n\n<p>The NPD contains data about nursery and school pupils in England dating back to 1995. It holds information on where children and young people live, aspects of their family background and whether they receive free school meals. At the moment, the data can only be shared for research purposes. Government is consulting on whether to alllow greater sharing to enable data products and information services to be developed.</p>\n\n<p>The ODI\u2019s Technical Director, \u0002Jeni Tennison said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s proposals as they stand, present a risk to peoples\u2019 privacy. Although the Department for Education has many layers of controls in place, the unintended consequence of aggregating different data sets can be that people are identifiable. There have been cases where developers at hack days have been able to find themselves in datasets like these. Whilst we welcome enabling research into the well-being of children and using this data to inform policy, commercial uses should be supported in other ways\u201d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ODI has suggested how useful aspects of the NPD could be made available as open data whilst protecting peoples\u2019 privacy by summarising the data in new ways. This would enable the private sector to create services for parents and teachers without generating additional bureaucracy and costs for the Department for Education.</p>\n\n<p>The ODI\u2019s CEO, Gavin Starks added:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cWe see great value from open data, such as the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/news/prescription-savings-worth-millions-identified-odi-incubated-company\">\u00a3200m/year potential saving for the NHS</a> we released last week. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and we need to take a measured view to unlocking insight. We have seen many examples of the unintended consequences of access to personal data, and we are keen to highlight and address these challenges, as well as delivering value. I am delighted to say that we are already in very constructive conversation with the Department for Education regarding their open data policies: working in collaboration and bringing together domain experts is core to the ODI&rsquo;s mission.\u201d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The government\u2019s NPD consultation closes on Tuesday 18th December.</p>\n\n<p>Links:<br />\n<a href=\"/consultation-response/proposed-amendments-individual-pupil-information-prescribed-persons\"><em>Read the full ODI response to the consultation</em></a><br />\n<a href=\"/blog/open-data-and-national-pupil-database\"><em>Read Jeni Tennison\u2019s blog on the NPD consultation</em></a></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/reflections-year-highs-lows-and-moments-pride.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/reflections-year-highs-lows-and-moments-pride","slug":"reflections-year-highs-lows-and-moments-pride","title":"Reflections on a year of highs, lows and moments of pride","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:22+01:00","created_at":"2013-01-15T17:47:12+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"What can be accomplished in a year?

A year ago I got involved with it as Nigel Shadbolt was writing the business plan and I am now based in the space that he described in that document. At the risk of sounding like an X Factor contestant, it has been an amazing journey to get to this point. There have been highs and lows, challenges and moments of pure pride as I worked with Nigel and Tim Organ (the project manager) through the business planning process and grant approval, starting to spread the word, moving into the building, meeting Gavin, Stuart and Jeni and making things happen.   </p>\n\n<p>Being part of the Cabinet Office <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/UKTransparency\">Transparency Team</a> is a real privilege. Transparency and Open Data is a new and unique policy area which has so much potential to touch people\u2019s lives in a very real way (which is actually why I joined the team). There are a lot of strong and passionate voices in this area and I would count colleagues in the Cabinet Office amongst them. I think it\u2019s fair to say (and Nigel would concur) that the ODI would not have made the same amount of progress in its implementation without the support of people like <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tkelsey1\">Tim Kelsey</a> (now at the NHS Commissioning Board), <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/PeteLawrence1\">Pete Lawrence</a> and Technology Strategy Board colleagues (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/iain_gray\">Iain Gray</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/david_bott\">David Bott</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hadleybeeman\">Hadley Beeman</a>). What is equally fair to say is that ODI is fulfilling a need. There was, and is, a desire for an organisation that can bring together different sectors and help them on their open data journeys.  </p>\n\n<p>I recently had a meeting with a Cabinet Office colleague who was interested in how the ODI came about and how long it took to set up. I talked through the process leading up to grant approval, the meetings we had with government colleagues and with industry, the practicalities of the first day, week, and month in a brand new office, determining how the ODI will work with its different stakeholders, running events, and the number of visitors we\u2019ve had. A huge amount happened to get us to the 1st October and an even greater amount has happened since. My colleague asked how much resource was involved. The answer: a small team with a lot of supporters.  </p>\n\n<p>The Open Data Institute is a world first. It straddles the public sector, industry and academia. It has a huge and ambitious remit and it is already delivering. I am, personally, very proud of what has been achieved through collaboration (Cabinet Office, Southampton University, TSB, Nigel, Gavin). Plans are being put into place for the Immersion Programme, further organisations are approaching the ODI about membership, more people are joining the organisation and I feel massively excited about all the ODI has to do in 2013 and beyond.  </p>\n\n<p>Olivia Burman is seconded to the ODI from the Cabinet Office where she works in the Transparency and Open Data Team</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Olivia Burman","slug":"olivia-burman","web_url":"http://theodi.org/olivia-burman","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Olivia Burman","slug":"olivia-burman","web_url":"http://theodi.org/olivia-burman","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/reliable-open-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/reliable-open-data","slug":"reliable-open-data","title":"Reliable Open Data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:33+01:00","created_at":"2013-10-17T13:52:08+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"The past couple of months have seen two outages in the open data space.

The true problems arise when the data itself is no longer accessible. Eric Mill from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com\">Sunlight Foundation</a> <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/10/02/government-apis-arent-a-backup-plan/\">called for government agencies</a> to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Publish downloadable bulk data</strong> before or concurrently with building an API.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Explicitly <strong>encourage reuse and republishing</strong> of their data. (Considering public reuse of data <a href=\"\">a risk to the public</a> is not recommended.)</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Document what data will remain</strong> during a shutdown, and keep this up all the time. Don&rsquo;t wait until the day before (or of) a shutdown.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Link to alternative sources</strong> for their data. Keep these links up during a shutdown.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The emphasis here, as in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://quoderat.megginson.com/2013/10/01/can-open-data-route-around-damage/\">David Megginson&rsquo;s post on routing around the damage</a> is on <strong>replication</strong> of data. This is something that is easy for <em>open</em> data because it (per the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendefinition.org/\">Open Definition</a>) lowers both legal and technical barriers in republishing data, which is necessary when providing an alternative source.</p>\n\n<p>But how do we make sure that open data <em>does</em> get replicated? There are three approaches that I&rsquo;ve seen suggested:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>storing data on <strong>third-party services</strong> rather than government services in the first place \u2014 though this leaves data availability contingent on the functioning of that third party rather than government when in general, government funding for services is pretty secure</li>\n  <li>relying on <strong>web archives</strong> \u2014 depending on their archiving strategy, this may omit recent data, and archives themselves are generally set up to aid <em>future</em> access and so not oriented to being a data backup service</li>\n  <li>relying on <strong>citizens and civil society organisations</strong> to take copies and then themselves make available public data \u2014 this activity will naturally focus on data that is of most interest to the individuals who take the time to copy it; unless there is organised activity to back up all data, and keep that backup current, this is likely to be patchy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So while I think Eric&rsquo;s set of recommendations are correct, I would add fifth:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Proactively <strong>ensure there are alternative sources</strong> for the data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While it seems to have fallen out of favour more recently, it used to be the case that code was routinely mirrored across multiple servers, through bilateral agreements between the organisations hosting that code. Governments and other organisations could enter into similar arrangements with each other, or with specialist mirroring services, as part of their contingency planning for service interruptions.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to see some experimentation with more radical options as well. For example, when there are key datasets that don&rsquo;t change frequently, the distributed nature of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent\">BitTorrent</a>, which distributes the storage of data through a network, may be a useful alternative to the more standard but centralised HTTP.</p>\n\n<p>Not all data can be easily replicated, which is why as Eric says, publishers should provide bulk downloads and not just APIs. But there are some services where the value of the data comes from its timeliness \u2014 for example, how the buses are running, the latest weather forecast, or new legislation. Replication of old data in these cases only helps to ensure historic analyses can be carried out. But most applications that rely on this kind of data will need something <em>current</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Even in the US government shutdown, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2013/13-A07.html\">Library of Congress preserved access to some services</a>, namely the legislative sites <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://THOMAS.gov\">THOMAS.gov</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://beta.congress.gov\">beta.congress.gov</a>. The US government has judged these information services as excepted from the general shutdown, as essential to operations as air traffic control.</p>\n\n<p>We should be asking for more data to be recognised as essential in this way, for more guarantees from governments about the availability of data in all circumstances. Only with such guarantees in place can we truly treat government information as infrastructure.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/revised-guide-open-data-business-cases.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/revised-guide-open-data-business-cases","slug":"revised-guide-open-data-business-cases","title":"Revised Guide on Open Data Business Cases","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:39+01:00","created_at":"2013-02-21T09:41:01+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"A few weeks ago, we invited comment on the draft of our guide \u201cHow to make a business case for open data\u201d.

We had around thirty comments, both within <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://personal.crocodoc.com/\">crocodoc</a> and via email, most of which have been incorporated into the published version of the guide.</p>\n\n<p>One theme of the comments that didn&rsquo;t lead to changes from the draft was that opening up data has a wider social good, while the business cases described in the document were focused on the good for the data publisher themselves. For example, fjlopez commented:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>IMHO the benefits of open data for the society at large cannot be well described with these business models (e.g. reduce data acquisition costs, enable the development of new products)\u200b</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/timdavies\">@timdavies</a> commented:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think the case for public sector needs more focus on public task and social value - which would have a different tone.\u200b</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The focus in this guide on short- to medium-term value for the data publisher themselves is deliberate. A business case for open data generally needs to convince sceptics. Long-term benefits, particularly for society as a whole rather than the organisation that is bearing the cost of publishing data, are unlikely to be convincing to them. This applies in the public sector as much as the private sector.</p>\n\n<p>A second set of comments that we didn&rsquo;t incorporate into the guide were those that said we should stress the importance of standards:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>@timdavies: Associating the opening of data with the impact of industry standards in bringing value to the industry; and in establishing a strong position for those who co-operate through common standards, might be useful to do.\u200b</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>@glyn_dk: Here it would be good to mention meta data standards are being developed in various fields to facilitate sharing and increase the value of the data shared.\u200b</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Michael: This point about data standards needs far more weight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are implementation costs but of course ultimately efficiencies and savings associated with data exchange standards adoption (that&rsquo;s partly why standards exist) and on the other hand, the value of the data (also financially) will be higher as the ease of extracting useful results from it will be far greater.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ultimately data is only as valuable as the information it conveys and for this you need properly developed semantic and syntactic standards.\u200b</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We agree that it&rsquo;s important to adopt standards formats and protocols when embarking on an open data project. But using standards is part of <em>how</em> you publish open data to get maximum value from it, not <em>why</em> you publish open data in the first place. This guide only addresses <em>why</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, many commenters requested more detailed case studies that demonstrated a business case being put together. We have added links to examples of businesses that use open data business models of the types discussed in the document, but it is one of our goals to put together more detailed case studies as time goes on.</p>\n\n<p>Our thanks to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/timdavies\">@timdavies</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/ntoll\">@ntoll</a>, fjlopez, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/ldodds\">@ldodds</a>, Simon Whitehouse, Brian, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/glyn_dk\">@glyn_dk</a>, Michael, Christopher Gutteridge and Michael Hopwood for their comments.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/seven-new-startups-join-the-odis-incubation-programme.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/seven-new-startups-join-the-odis-incubation-programme","slug":"seven-new-startups-join-the-odis-incubation-programme","title":"Seven new companies  join the ODI\u2019s startup programme","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:44:56+01:00","created_at":"2014-06-26T15:31:51+01:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Seven new open data startups have today (27th June) joined the ODI startup programme from a diverse range of industry backgrounds:  ","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"\n<p>Seven new open data startups have today (27th June) joined the ODI startup programme from a diverse range of industry backgrounds:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.icanmake.co/\">I Can Make</a> creates kits for parents and teachers to use 3D printers with children.

The startup programme is part of the ODI\u2019s mission to explore new business models, and to demonstrate the power of open innovation.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mike Darby, Chief Technology Officer at Demand Logic, which joined the startup programme in July 2013, said:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;When we joined the ODI startup programme there was suddenly a huge injection of energy and expertise. The level of encouragement exceeded anything we could have hoped for. There was a huge change in our drive - we went from startup to professional outfit in a short space of time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Alison Smith, Founder at Pesky People, one of the new startups announced today said: </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We\u2019re really excited about working with the ODI on our new mobile app called HELP 999 - a touch screen text service which we believe will dramatically improve deaf people\u2019s access to 999SMS assistance, making it simple and quick. Open data is the key to our service. There is currently no data on the number of calls made by deaf people to 999, which means that call patterns are being missed, and there are no statistics for how long it takes to answer a 999 call from a deaf caller. We create that data and make it open, delivering realtime geo-mapping of incidents, and offering a direct link between callers and blue light services, improving the experience for deaf people contacting 999 in an emergency.&rdquo;</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"Seven new businesses join the ODI\u2019s startup programme","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Open Data Institute","slug":"odi","web_url":"http://theodi.org/odi","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/smart-london.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/smart-london","slug":"smart-london","title":"Smart London","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:57+01:00","created_at":"2013-09-04T10:36:06+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"London\u2019s Mayor set up a \u2018Smart London\u2019 board to look at how the capital can best use technology and data, to ensure it remains one of the world\u2019s most efficient and liveable cities.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p>London&rsquo;s Mayor <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/news/odi-ceo-joins-mayor%E2%80%99s-smart-london-board\">set up</a> a \u2018Smart London\u2019 board to look at how the capital can best use technology and data, to ensure it remains one of the world\u2019s most efficient and liveable cities.\u0002\nTo increase my understanding, I&rsquo;ve asked as many people as I can (mostly via <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/agentGav/status/357912408804691969\">twitter</a>) for their comments, and\u0002made sure that their voices are <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dgen/9316685748/\">included</a>.

There is SO MUCH to do to improve the place. What makes London amazing is its a glorious mess. A heaving, stinking compost pile of all that is good and bad from everywhere. The miracle is all that makes London one of the best cities in the world emerges out of this glorious mess. My vision is to make London an easier place to be. More people oriented and unpick the legacy infrastructure and policies that make life harder here. Eg Tower Hamlets recently built a cycle lane in Bethnal Green that has a street lamp and parking meter in the middle of the lane. Duh! More street sweepers and power washing the pavements. Basic stuff! I had an epiphany after stumbling into City Hall and walking into debate of the LGA where Boris was getting a grilling and giving as good as he got. A deep experience of a democracy in rude health. I think London is an example to the world in that regard. I think tech could help make it more truly engaging for more Londoners and help evolve democracy into the 21st century. There&rsquo;s always more that can be done to improve access to public data and make it more usable eg through visualisations and mashups.

I learnt that a lot of data is collected by the government and that this data is made available to the public. This can include data like tweets, car accidents and anti-social behaviour in different areas of the country. The data is then used by other public and private companies to make life better for the people who reside in the different areas.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the day we were shown different examples of how data can be used to make decisions that affect the lives of many people. We were shown how public data can be accessed and how to use software tools to analyse and question the data sets and to draw conclusions based on the results of our query.</p>\n\n<p>I took a lot of information out of this workshop and I would love to have the opportunity to do it again.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Bethel Atterh, Year 10 student, Aged 14</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>\u201cBeing part of the Deloitte Mash-Up has been such a fantastic and educational once-in-a-lifetime experience.

However, I left with a much better understanding of public data and how it can be used.

It was a great opportunity to see some old friends, make some new contacts, and catch up on the state of the art in Open Data. I particularly enjoyed the talk about how the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/2013/04/odw/odw13_submission_57.pdf\">Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (the German National Library) is opening up its data under a CC0 license</a> (PDF), and the panel on Product Data, where we heard Tesco, NXP Semiconductor and GS1 actually making the business case for open data. I feel our work here is done!</p>\n\n<p>Back at the office, Ulrich, Stu and Sam were left holding the baby. Ulrich finally revealed what <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/what-do-statisticians-think-big-data\">statisticians really think about Big Data</a>, while Stu was plugged away building <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dashboards.theodi.org/\">dashboards.theodi.org</a> with the exceptionally handsome <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://shopify.github.io/dashing/\">Dashing</a>. Sam, with practical help (but mostly moral support) from the rest of us moved the ODI Web site between cloud providers, piece by piece. It was awesome to flip the switch, detect a problem with images missing from the CDN, and flip the switch back while we fixed the issue. There was no downtime in the whole process, and the site is now in the hands of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opscode.com/chef/\">culinary robots</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To cap the week off, I got to be opinionated in front of an audience at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.amiando.com/BDWLondon2013.html?page=943580\">Imperial College for Big Data week</a>, and we even got <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/lectures.json\">some more of</a> <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/courses.json\">our own data</a> published on the ODI site. It&rsquo;s a small helping of dogfood, but dogfood nonetheless. Next week (actually this week) is 20% week.

He also hacked <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\">Raspberry Pi</a>s with Andrea, our Training and Events Coordinator,\u0002and tested to see if they had enough grunt to drive the screens (they don&rsquo;t, unless we can offload more of the work to the GPU), helped Ulrich get setup on Rackspace collecting data about Boris Bikes, and enabled one of our pods for videoconferencing using the Samsung SmartTV.</p>\n\n<p>James went to UCL to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/research-software-development/seminar-smith-odi/\">deliver a presenation on our open development practices</a>, (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.github.io/open-development/talk/#/titlepage\">you can see the slides here</a>), and worked on a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://git-viewer.labs.theodi.org/\">Rails app that displays open data stored in Git repositories</a>\u0002in\u0002a nice way for non-developers.</p>\n\n<p>I worked on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/odibot\">various different scripts</a> for our IRC bot, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://hubot.github.com/\">Hubot</a> to do various life-embettering things like add bookmarks to Pinboard, alert us to when the 10am standup is happening (and give a link to the Google Hangout - handy for\u0002remote workers!), link automatically to issues in Github\u0002and also silly things like\u0002generate random words on the fly (this has already saved us several man hours in naming new projects - because naming things is hard).</p>\n\n<p>Sam worked on (in his words) <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/vagrant-provide-o-matic\">a horrorshow of a Vagrantfile</a> which will allow us to spin up nodes on the fly for either VirtualBox (when we&rsquo;re developing on our local machines) or Rackspace (when we want to put stuff into production). Once the rough edges are smoothed out, this will prove to be really useful.</p>\n\n<p>Ulrich worked on collecting data about Boris Bike cycle hire data using R, with a view to collecting a decent amount of statistical data so we can find out interesting patterns of usage. He also worked on a benefit case for opening up the DVLA&rsquo;s bulk data set as open data, and organised a meeting with various privacy experts\u0002to discuss the privacy section of the Open Data Certificate.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, it was a great week, and I think all of us packed a lot into five days. While we may not have got many demonstratable projects out of the sprint (it was only a week after all), it&rsquo;s helped lay some groundwork for some useful future projects, and we&rsquo;ve all leant at least one useful thing that we can carry forward into future work.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Stuart Harrison","slug":"stuart-harrison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-harrison","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Stuart Harrison","slug":"stuart-harrison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-harrison","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tech-team-week-notes-33.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/tech-team-week-notes-33","slug":"tech-team-week-notes-33","title":"Tech Team Week Notes #33","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:39:59+01:00","created_at":"2013-05-21T18:04:56+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/opentech.jpg\" alt=\"OpenTech\" /></p>\n\n<p>Last week saw important progress on a few projects we&rsquo;re working on.

There&rsquo;s always so much &lsquo;real work&rsquo; to do that taking the time to complete the week notes takes real discipline, and keeping track of the many things we&rsquo;re each doing is no small task.</p>\n\n<p>To try and address that, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/james-smith\">James</a> got us setup recently with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://offbott.com/\">Offbott</a> (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/stml/offbot\">code on GitHub</a>), a neat little service that periodically emails you to ask what you&rsquo;ve been doing. Hit &lsquo;Reply&rsquo;, add a brief summary of the day&rsquo;s work, and this goes into the collective pot for your project. You can then review it online and get a weekly email digest of everyone&rsquo;s activity.</p>\n\n<p>So is it solving our problems? To an extent, yes. We have 4/7 of the team actively using it, and the weekly records provide a decent summary. Personally I find it useful to stop and record where the day has gone, though some way to indicate the relative effort involved in each task would be helpful. On the flip side, the greater the structure needed in the emails, the greater the effort required to file a report &ndash; and it&rsquo;s precisely that simplicity that encourages me to participate.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway&hellip;last week was our 20% week. James was away, as was <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/jeni\">Jeni</a> for some of the week. The rest of her time was spent tying up loose ends for the upcoming launch of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.github.io/open-data-certificate/\">Open Data Certificate</a>. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/stuart-harrison\">Stuart</a> embarked on his project to automatically identify &lsquo;data&rsquo; areas/microsites on\u0002Local Authority Web sites, and see what proportion of them are reachable within three clicks of the homepage (one of the criteria in the Certificate). The simple answer is &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard&rdquo;, not least because many sites return an <em>HTTP 200 OK</em> when they actually mean <em>404 Not Found</em>. Stu&rsquo;s 20% of 20% project, inspired by BBC Watchdog, involved creating a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.pezholio.co.uk/2013/06/my-response-to-bbc-watchdog-a-chrome-plugin-for-just-eat/\">Chrome Plugin</a> that revealed his favourite takeaway has declining hygiene standards.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/sam-pikesley\">Sam</a> spent the week in the depths of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-rackspace/pull/4#issuecomment-19056323\">Vagrant</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/zpatten/cc-chef-repo/issues/3#issuecomment-18969432\">Cucumber Chef</a>, hoping that someone would eventually hear his cries and merge his pull requests. Continuing the food theme, I mined historic menu data from one of our favourite local eateries and attempted to predict whether particular options would be served on a particular day. A trivial use case, but some interesting learnings and powerful examples of the benefits of structured data. Yes, it&rsquo;s possible to parse menu data from plain text (using Regexp, IMAP, and Gmail as the backend!), but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be that hard. It was also great to dust off my R skills to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2010/01/21/how-to-make-a-heatmap-a-quick-and-easy-solution/\">generate a heatmap</a> of the results.</p>\n\n<p>As for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/people/ulrich-atz\">Ulrich</a>, he&rsquo;s been so busy that he didn&rsquo;t even manage to have his 20% time.

But in particular I&rsquo;m going to be talking about the impact that open data will have on our society, a change which I&rsquo;m calling the Data Reformation.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s first rewind about 500 years. This picture is of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Bible\">German Language Bible, translated by Martin Luther</a>. The fact that this Bible was written in German was literally revolutionary. Before Martin Luther, Bibles were written in Latin, they could only be read by scholarly monks. They were closed, available only to restricted sets of people. Martin Luther made his Bible open. He translated the Bible into German, the language that people actually spoke.</p>\n\n<p>The German Language Bible was a crucial part of a massive social change that we now term The Reformation.</p>\n\n<p>Before The Reformation, the Bible was walled off behind doctrine: essentially what monks and priests said the Bible said. Everything that normal people knew about what the Bible said was received second hand. Which of course meant that the monks and priests had tremendous power. They could ignore some bits of the Bible and emphasise others, and no one would ever know. The opening of the Bible, through its translation into the language that they spoke, enabled lay people to directly engage with the word of God.</p>\n\n<p>And the effects of that were enormous. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ninety-Five_Theses#Reaction\">Wikipedia identifies three particular effects</a> that I wanted to highlight.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>People were able to test the fidelity of what monks and priests told them against what the Bible actually said. And naturally that led to changes in the power dynamic between the people and the church.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>There was still the need for informed interpretation. It wasn&rsquo;t the case that everyone sat and studied the Bible (although they could). There were lots of new interpretations. Some of them were slightly nuts. But the important thing was that because the Bible was open for everyone to read, there could be educated and informed arguments about these interpretations.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The availability of the Bible to individuals made them want to know more. They engaged more with what the Bible said, because they could read it themselves. And they changed their behaviour as a result, becoming more invested in and interested in what religion was to them.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously you&rsquo;re not here to listen to a lecture about religious events from 500 years ago. You&rsquo;re here to learn about digital stuff! So what&rsquo;s all that got to do with us, here and now? Well, the same changes that arose 500 years ago because of the publication of an open Bible are happening now because of open data.</p>\n\n<p>There is the same dynamic at play. Currently, most data is locked behind a wall of analysis. We are reliant on statisticians and analysts to perform analyses, creating reports that tell us what the data says, in just the same way as lay people were reliant on monks and priests. We are reliant on them asking the questions that we are interested in and providing us with the summaries and visualisations that make sense of it for us.</p>\n\n<p>But some organisations are starting to open up their data. They are making their data legally available for everyone to use and reuse and do with what they will. I think that this will have dramatic effects on our society, just as the Protestant Reformation did. Which is why I&rsquo;ve decided to call this <strong>The Data Reformation</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Now there are all sorts of things going on with data right now, all sorts of interesting things that Big Data can tell us. All sorts of issues and concerns about the collection of personal data. There were all sorts of changes going on through the Protestant Reformation too.</p>\n\n<p>But to me it was the opening up of the Bible that was the most subtly revolutionary part. It was that crucial step that turned the academic arguments within the church into a global movement, into a revolution.</p>\n\n<p>And I think the same is true in the Data Reformation. We need data to be open to enable everyone to be involved in the conversations that we need to have about what data should be collected and what data should be shared. Because the Data Reformation will change our society, and we need everyone to be involved in that change.</p>\n\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"//www.scribd.com/embeds/228408962/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=slideshow&amp;access_key=key-bDgf0cc3XNiKxfTt26c0&amp;show_recommendations=false\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7790927021696252\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_46385\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/new-industrialists-part-1-open-data-enabling-new-primary-industry-or-speeding-existing-one.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/new-industrialists-part-1-open-data-enabling-new-primary-industry-or-speeding-existing-one","slug":"new-industrialists-part-1-open-data-enabling-new-primary-industry-or-speeding-existing-one","title":"The New Industrialists (Part 1): Open Data - Enabling a new primary industry or speeding up the existing one?","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:08+01:00","created_at":"2012-11-04T16:44:32+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"Consider the question: Has information technology got close to fulfilling it\u2019s potential?

Accessing then extracting the insight we need from the information and vast data available to make the right decision at the right time is the bit that makes the difference. The promise of analytics is not new. The tech industry has seen a rebirth of cloud based propositions that can suck up data and supposedly spit out insight. All too often these solutions have only been affordable to medium sized and large businesses and all too often the bit after the insight is forgotten. How do I best communicate the information to my audience? How do I make the data visually simple yet compelling and relevant to the business people ? Companies like <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.geckoboard.com/\">geckoboard</a> are breaking this open, as are an increasing number of propositions provided on a pay-per-use model.</p>\n\n<h3>The open data promise?</h3>\n\n<p>What can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data\">Open data</a> deliver? Let\u2019s start with the government\u2019s data: some might argue that if we dust off and unlock that treasure chest., the information potential for society, for commerce is huge. In this utopia, startups will flourish by moving in to assist with the supply and demand and the trickle of most useful data will work itself out and become a steady flow. If only it were that easy. Publishing the data is not enough. Getting the scale and focus right n the early stages, on which data to supply and which to request, is critical to building a sustainable model. Watch this space for some analysis we plan to co-publish later in 2012.</p>\n\n<h3>What is in it for businesses and for us?</h3>\n\n<p>The word free confuses and scares the business folk - how can I <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.freemium.org/\">build a business on free?</a> Open data does mean freely available to access, use and share but that does not restrict smart use to create paid for value-add services around that access. Take transport data: having a fire hose of data on TFL is no good to a business. Having that <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://placr.co.uk/index.php\">data aggregated, structured and accessible in an automated way is worth paying for</a>. There are many <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/172\">open data business models</a> taking shape. Why should I make my data available? Which data should be open and which closed? What really needs to be understood is that the value of \u201copen\u201d is that it can enable completely different way to innovate and invent new business models often where the current model is mature but can be built open or adapted. Take <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.noddle.co.uk/\">noddle from callcredit</a> - a consumer service empowering personal ownership and accountability for credit scoring.</p>\n\n<p>What should be the important characteristics of open data? Let\u2019s consider one simple data item: the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/dataset/gross_domestic_product-preliminary_estimate_\">gross domestic product of the UK</a> or the annual <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opencorporates.com/\">revenue of a company</a>. We need to ask: Is the available data maintained by an authoritative source? If financially derived, Is it audited and how do I know? Will it be updated next year? If the data I need is in a closed pdf file, I will need to manually open and search. Far better if I can automatically link my software or website to the data needed in a structured way. Then it becomes information. It may all sound simple but data really does deserve better.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>If software is really going to eat the world then data is a core fuel source. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/\">Open data and money</a> are going to help by enabling the mass market to source, supply and consume it with better outcomes. This will enable the innovators and inventors to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html\">build stuff that matters</a> and build stuff that works! Open data can unlock more value in the existing data market and has the potential to create a new industry of businesses driving demand and supply across all sectors Open data is both speeding up the value in IT and forging a new industry. Get involved. If you have data that can bring value to others open it up!</p>\n\n<p><em>Stuart Coleman is Commercial Director of The ODI (read more on his <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/stuart-coleman\">full profile</a>).

This helps us measure how well we&rsquo;re doing against our metrics, and ensures we have a list of people in the office in case of a fire. Using open technologies and standards has enabled us to expand this system to meet the needs of the space and the people working within.</p>\n\n<p>If you have visited the ODI then you will have inevitably come across our electronic sign-in that greets you as soon as you\u0002exit the lift. This system has proved very effective and allows us to assess our impact both on a local and global scale.</p>\n\n<p>The main physical presence comes in the form of an iPad loaded with the ready-made <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://maxcorso.wix.com/receptionsignin\">Sign In</a> application. While not an open source application, at the time this was the only suitable application, in any mobile store, able to be quickly customised and allow extraction of the data.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/odi_sign_in_pic.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><em>The sign in system with current visitors displayed on the screens in the background</em>The Sign In application is able to be run on multiple iPads, each located at different entrances and exists on your building. So that a visitor can enter via one entrance and exit via another, the application synchronises its data using a series of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML\">XML</a> files passed between each device. Thus in order to extract the data in real time (rather than receive a summary email once a day), we built a program to emulate an iPad and which simply receives the data like it is just another device. One script later and we have piped all the data into the visitor system database ready to used by other parts of the system.</p>\n\n<p>As we move forward, it is intended that this proprietary part of the system be replaced with an open source solution built on top of the platform that has evolved in the last six months. However in the time allowed, we are very appreciative for the pre-built application and are happy to share our experiences of extracting your data from the application&rsquo;s closed wall architecture.</p>\n\n<p>It soon became clear that entering details on a touch screen each time you visit does not create the best experience, especially for staff that are in the office on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>The initial solution to this problem involved complementing the sign-in system with a web interface when people can simply click their picture to sign in and out of the office each day. While this worked for some time, during one of our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/tech-team-week-notes-31\">20% weeks</a>, I decided to investigate the potential of using an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification\">RFID</a> card reader to allow people to simply touch in and out of the office using one of the many cards we carry in our wallets.</p>\n\n<p>In order to both save the environment and space in peoples wallets we don\u2019t issue an RFID card. Using an off-the-shelf <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE\">MiFare 1K</a> card reader allows people to associate many different cards to their profile including Oyster, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITSO_Ltd\">ITSO</a> and contactless payment cards.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>Using a contactless card read has dramatically reduced the effort required to sign in and out and also improved the quality of the data. Making the process so simple has encouraged people to touch in and out at lunchtime in addition to either end of the day. Although it is still unconfirmed if the increase in data is somehow linked to the Star Trek computer sounds that play when you touch in and out.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/Sign_in_architecture.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>System architecture of the ODI sign in system</em>\u0002\nThe diagram above shows the architecture of the system. As should be evident, the system is very modular and all the different parts\u0002communicate with the processor node using an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface\">Application Programming Interface (API)</a> based upon the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\">HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a> as intended by our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/people/timbl\">illustrious director</a>. The Star Trek computer sounds are directly mapped to the HTTP status codes that best represent each one<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>By building a modular system that re-uses a lot of existing technology, including the RFID card we all carry, introduces a huge cost saving of purchasing a complex electronic visitor system. Our aim in the near future is to replace the dependency on the closed source iPad application. This way the whole system can be run using a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi\">Raspberry Pi</a>, cheaper tablet and an RFID card reader. This brings the cost of the entire system into the sub \u00a3400 bracket<sup>3</sup>. This will also mean that we can continue to expand the system to allow assignment of desk space and allow all visitors to associate RFID cards.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to deploy your own system then all the code modules are available on\u0002<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.github.com/theodi/signin-web\">GitHub</a>. For more information you can contact the ODI tech team on tech@theodi.org or join our IRC channel (#theodi on irc.freenode.net)</p>\n\n<p><small>&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Before people start worrying that we can make charges to your Oyster and Bank cards, this is not possible. Contactless cards all contain a generic serial number put on by the manufacturer and this number is not associated with the use of the card, so although we collect this number so you can sign in and out of the ODI quickly, it is not possible for us to tell what type of card you used, only that you have one.</small></p>\n\n<p><small>&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Finding codes for some sounds proved a real challenge, e.g. 418</small></p>\n\n<p><small>&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Based upon the tablet being a Nexus 10 or iPad 2.</small></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"David Tarrant","slug":"david-tarrant","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/david-tarrant","tag_ids":["team","commercial"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"David Tarrant","slug":"david-tarrant","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/david-tarrant","tag_ids":["team","commercial"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/the-odi-and-sir-nigel-shadbolt-are-at-cebit.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/the-odi-and-sir-nigel-shadbolt-are-at-cebit","slug":"the-odi-and-sir-nigel-shadbolt-are-at-cebit","title":"The ODI and Sir Nigel Shadbolt are at CeBit 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:12+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-07T16:39:57+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"Director Stuart Coleman will be in Hannover next week at the world\u2019s leading technology event with over 230,000 visitors from more than 120 countries.","excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/19/eb/5319eb4df362be6c870000c4/cb_logo_col.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"attachment-5319eb4dd0d4622c01000013\" /></p>\n\n<h3>10th - 14th March 2014 - Hannover, Hall 9, stand C44</h3>\n\n<p>ODI Chairman and Co-founder Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Commercial Director Stuart Coleman will be in Hannover next week at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cebit.de/home\">CeBIT2014</a> \u2013 the world\u2019s leading technology event with over 230,000 visitors from more than 120 countries.</p>\n\n<p>The keynote theme at CeBIT this year is &ldquo;Datability&rdquo; \u2013 the ability to process and use vast quantities of data responsibly and sustainably. </p>\n\n<p>The UK is this year\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.cebit.de/&amp;prev=/search?q%3DceBIT%26espv%3D210%26es_sm%3D93\">official partner country</a>, and the ODI has been working with the UK Government (UKTI) to showcase the value and potential of open data to the economy and businesses.</p>\n\n<h3>The ODI at CeBIT:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>The ODI will have a stand at the event (Hall 9, C44), and is welcoming anyone who wants to know more about the potential of open data.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Chairman and Co-founder Sir Nigel Shadbolt is giving a keynote speech on Centre Stage, hall 8, on Tuesday 11th March at 11.30am about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cebit.de/speaker/sir-nigel-shadbolt/1152\">The Power of Open Data</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Stuart Coleman, ODI Commercial Director, will be chairing the &lsquo;Big Data and the Future of the web&rsquo; seminar in the British Business Lounge/Hall of Nations on Tuesday 11th March, 12-2 pm and will be on the panel for the &lsquo;UK tech startup ecosystem&rsquo; seminar on Wednesday 12th March, 12-2pm.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Stuart says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&ldquo;In 2013, the ODI convened global data leaders from industry, academia, government and the third sectors and connected 100s of innovators and implementers.

The ODI is a collaboration between leading businesses and entrepreneurs, universities and researchers, government and civil society to unlock enterprise and social value from the vast amount of Open Data now being made accessible. As a collaborative, dynamic space which will host a diverse range of innovators, we are aiming for the commissioned artwork to give visual momentum to the environment, by bringing the space alive and inspiring new perspectives on Open Data. As an equal opportunity organisation The ODI welcomes applications from all artists, irrespective of ethnic origin, gender, marital status, sexuality, age or disability. Our offices are accessible. Please help us monitor the diversity of artists working in this area by completing our equality questionnaire with your submission. The ODI has engaged <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mztek.org\">MzTEK</a> to manage this exciting commissioning process. MzTEK is a non-profit organisation with the aim of addressing the imbalance of women artists working in the fields of new media, computer arts, and technology.

This week in London two back to back summits are being held to discuss it. <a href=\"summit.theodi.org\">The first</a> organised by the Open Data Institute (ODI) will bring together innovators, entrepreneurs and digital developers to demonstrate the results of open data innovation. The second is an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/get-involved/london-summit-2013\">Open Government Partnership Summit</a> representing 60 countries and involving senior leadership from governments and NGOs - they too will be waxing lyrical about the power of open data. Why is this abstract, geeky term getting so much attention? What is open data, what difference does it make and why should we care?</p>\n\n<p>Open data is data that is freely available over the Web for anyone to reuse without restriction. Over the last few years, governments in the UK and overseas have been opening up more of their information. This led to the establishment of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk\">data.gov.uk</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov\">data.gov</a> and other state-run websites that hold or point to public sector information. The data can range from information about reported crime to train timetables, from details of government spending to copies of contracts, from infection rates in hospitals to the quality of bathing water. Open data released by government is non-personal data or else data that is aggregated or anonymised so that individuals cannot be identified from it.</p>\n\n<p>This open data is the raw material used to build new services and because it is open anyone can get in on the act. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mastodonc.com/\">Mastodon C</a>, one of the start-ups hosted by the ODI, took the prescription data published each month by GPs in England. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://prescribinganalytics.com/\">They showed</a> that for just one class of drugs, statins, if GPs had prescribed the generic version rather than the more expensive patented version the NHS could have saved over \u00a3200 million in one year. They now have contracts in place to do more analysis. The challenge now is to use this kind of insight to change behaviour. But it is clear that open data can increase transparency, improve efficiency and create real economic value - a winning combination.</p>\n\n<p>Publishing open data also increases engagement and participation by the public. This happened with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.police.uk\">police.uk</a> site that shows the open data around reported crime and justice outcomes. Since it launched it has had over 53 million visits from 22% of all family households in England and Wales. Public Health England\u2019s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://longerlives.phe.org.uk/\">Longer Lives</a> site also attracted national attention when it published open data around mortality rates in England. It shows wide variation between local authorities with two and a half times as many premature deaths in Manchester versus Richmond on Thames - it also showed how authorities with similar levels of socioeconomic deprivation were doing against authorities with similar profiles. The potential outcomes from this kind of innovation include matching services much more effectively to need, on a local level.</p>\n\n<p>Can this extend beyond the public sector? Can commercial companies gain value from the trend towards open data? To date the ODI has hosted and helped 10 start-up companies who are building new businesses out of open data. Interestingly, many of these businesses are doing much of their work with the public sector. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.carbonculture.net/\">Carbon Culture</a> is helping Cardiff City Council and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea to reduce their carbon footprint by publishing real-time information about energy consumption in council buildings. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.spendnetwork.com/\">Spend Network</a> (launching in November) will help public sector buyers save money by creating the first comprehensive and publicly available website for government transaction data - it will provide real insight as to the cost of equivalent or identical items and services across government. This will make public sector transactions open to public scrutiny - the \u201cdisinfectant of sunlight\u201d as the Prime Minister once famously described it. Apps created by private companies, such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://transportapi.com/\">Transport API</a> another ODI housed start-up, are using travel open data from Transport for London. This is estimated to have saved the London economy up to \u00a358m a year, as commuters alter their journeys to avoid disruption and arrive at work on time</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the supply of useful data from the private sector is gathering pace. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dynamicinsights.telefonica.com/\">Telefonica Dynamic Insights</a> is committing to making fully anonymised and aggregated mobile network data available publicly for the first time. The ODI has worked with Telefonica to show how this data, combined with public sector information can build new, open tools that demonstrate to citizens and government officials the possible outcomes of their choices. As a first step, the team have built a website that uses the data to show the effects of proposed changes to the London Fire Brigade - the effects of closing this or that Fire Station. Until now, most of this sort of decision making has taken place behind closed doors.</p>\n\n<p>A year ago, in the UK, the ODI opened its doors, its mission was to use open data to transform public services, enhance policy making, foster new open-data businesses and drive the creation of economic and social value. A year later and responding to huge interest from around the world we will be  announcing at our Summit on Tuesday new ODI nodes across the globe. The ODI is helping promote an idea whose time has come. Open data supports open innovation - potentially one of the most disruptive developments the Web has fostered. Anyone can access the primary data of government national and local, anyone can look to use that data to provide a more transparent, efficient and profitable service or application. It is an idea that is taking hold in the private sector too. No one expects the Public Sector to act as an agent of transformative change.

As a PhD student in the mid-2000s I had an amazing world of opportunity around me. We did, and still do, live in interesting times &ndash; in a good way. But there was a nagging feeling that I&rsquo;d missed the boat.</p>\n\n<p>Over the preceding decade or so the Web had revolutionised so many aspects of our lives, but the revolution wasn&rsquo;t over yet, and until it was, the world wouldn&rsquo;t be ready for any next big thing, however marvellous. These cycles of innovation and technology adoption take a long time &ndash; maybe a generation or more &ndash; by which time I&rsquo;d be over the hill and no longer flush with youthful creativity.</p>\n\n<p>I realise now that I needn&rsquo;t have worried. The Web has unlocked such a rich bounty of opportunity that I see no end in sight. My own priorities or interests will change long before I ever run out of interesting topics to work on, fuelled by the dynamics of the Web.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://info.cern.ch/\">On this day in particular</a> it&rsquo;s worth reflecting on what enabled the Web to become so pervasive. Much has already been said about the open principles underlying the Web as a hypertext system: distributed publishing, no centralised control, minimal consistency requirements, and later, open standards. But much less is said about another aspect of openness that may be of equal or greater importance &ndash; the terms under which CERN gifted the original software to the public domain *.</p>\n\n<p>No license, no attribution requirements, nothing. It&rsquo;s worth stopping and reading the statement that encodes this waiver of rights. It&rsquo;s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399\">available as an image</a> (behind a rather unfortunate copyright notice) and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://lynx.isc.org/release/lynx2-8-7/WWW/FreeofCharge.html\">parts of the second page as text</a>.

I was a little surprised to discover quite how many different licences and licence variants have been created.</p>\n\n<h2>UK Open Government Licences</h2>\n\n<p>The UK Open Government Licence (UK-OGL) is now used to support the publication of the majority of public sector open data in the UK. Based on feedback from the community, the original version of the licence (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/1/\">UK-OGL-1.0</a>) has been updated to version 2 (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/\">UK-OGL-2.0</a>) which, among other improvements, clarifies its compatibility with the Creative Commons Attribution licence.</p>\n\n<p>But not all public sector data in the UK uses this licence. The Ordnance Survey have their own <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/licences/os-opendata-licence.pdf\">OS Open Data Licence</a> that is derived from the Open Government Licence. Originally based on version 1, it was recently updated to version 2. The licence adds some guidance on attribution and a clause on sub-licensing. But it is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/2013-July/000549.html\">unclear what this clause actually covers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Natural England also use variants of both the Open Government and OS Open Data Licences. Their simplest licence, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/open-government-licence-NE_tcm6-30744.pdf\">NE-OGL</a> is based on UK-OGL Version 1 but adds an attribution statement. Other versions of their licences, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/licence-ne-os-lnr_tcm6-33088.pdf\">NE-OS</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/open-government-licence-NE-OS_tcm6-30743.pdf\">NE-OS-LNR</a> are variations of the first version of the OS Open Data licence. They both have slightly different attribution statements and the same sub-licensing clause.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note: a previous version of this post wrongly suggested that the Natural England licences were versions of the same licence, when in fact they are different licences used for different types of datasets. See comments for discussion.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Data publishers have also created other &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; copies of the UK-OGL by copying the text of the licence to the terms and conditions page of their website. See, for example, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://tunbridgewellsmuseum.info/default.aspx?page=4370\">Tunbridge Wells Borough Council</a> and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hscic.gov.uk/terms-and-conditions\">Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre</a> (HSCIC). In both cases those pages include a full copy of the text of UK-OGL Version 1, although you&rsquo;d have to read through it in detail to confirm that. In fact the HSCIC have modified the licence to include their own attribution statement. </p>\n\n<p>To add a little more confusion, the references to the original copy of the licence on those pages use a URL that automatically redirects to the latest version of UK-OGL (Version 2), not the version they&rsquo;ve chosen to apply (Version 1). It would have been more useful to have simply linked to the original licence text.</p>\n\n<h2>Canadian Open Government Licences</h2>\n\n<p>The UK Open Government Licence has also been used as a basis for creating licences in other jurisdictions, most notably in Canada. Unfortunately this has lead to the creation of yet more variants. </p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://clipol.org/\">CIPPIC Licensing Information Project for Open Licences</a> has some great tools for exploring open licences, including tools for visualising relationships between licences and comparing their text. </p>\n\n<p>For example, here is a diagram that shows <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://clipol.org/licences/94?tab=licence_comparison\">some of the family of licences derived from the UK-OGL</a>. Some of these are derived from Version 1 whilst others are derived from Version 2. </p>\n\n<p>Canada also has a whole other family of licences used in various city data portals. The &ldquo;<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://clipol.org/licences/16?tab=licence_comparison\">G4 Canada family</a>&rdquo; consists of a number of variants of a core licence originally created by Vancouver.</p>\n\n<p>A <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.opennorth.ca/2012/09/19/lessons-from-represent-licenses/\">review of the creation and spread of the G4 licenses</a> suggests that some cities are moving towards adopting variants of the UK-OGL.</p>\n\n<p>For example <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=4a37e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD0\">the Toronto licence</a> is a variant of the Ontario licence, but notes that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The only substantive changes in this licence are to replace direct references to the Province of Ontario with the City of Toronto and the inclusion of a provision for the Ontario Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.countygp.ab.ca/EN/main/community/maps-gis/open-data/open-data-licence.html\">County of Grande Prairie license</a> explains that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The only substantive changes in this licence are to replace direct references to the Province of Alberta with the County of Grande Prairie.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Creating a new licence simply to add some branding seems entirely unnecessary. Updating a licence to include references to local legislation may be reasonable, but is still arguably unnecessary: regardless of the licence text you still need to conform to local laws, e.g. on data protection. An open data licence can&rsquo;t give you a pass to ignore relevant legislation. It&rsquo;s debatable whether the best place to include references to such legislation is in the licence text or in supporting documentation.</p>\n\n<h1>Curbing License Proliferation</h1>\n\n<p>Clearly there are some repeated patterns here. Standard licences are being forked and possibly modified text is being copied around for various reasons, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>to replace generic attribution requirements with a specific attribution statement desired by the publisher</li>\n  <li>to localise the licence to refer to local legislation</li>\n  <li>to add branding, e.g. logos and names of cities or jurisdictions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is all adding largely unnecessary overhead for data consumers who need to understand whether any of these changes are relevant, often by reviewing the licence text. Licence proliferation adds complexity for re-users, especially if <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/guides/licence-compatibility.md\">licences may be incompatible</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Open source software also suffers from a proliferation of licences, but these tend to be completely independent licences. There&rsquo;s a danger that the open data community might end up in a worse situation with dozens of slightly different licences based on slightly different versions of a few core licences. </p>\n\n<p>Needless proliferation doesn&rsquo;t help anyone. Now would be a good time for the community to provide feedback to publishers to try and curb further proliferation. It would be far better if data publishers were to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>provide a clear stable link to a standard (country-level) licence</strong>, not complete copies of licences</li>\n  <li>clearly <strong>indicate which version of a licence they are using</strong>, or note that they are intentionally tracking the latest version</li>\n  <li><strong>supplement links with guidance on the context for data re-use</strong>, specifically their preferred attribution statement and pointers to relevant legislation</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The ODI has already published some guidance for publishers on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/guides/publisher-guide.md\">how to publish rights statements in a clear, machine-readable format</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If a custom licence is deemed to be necessary then this should have:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>a stable URL for each version of the licence, and a pointer to the latest version of the document</li>\n  <li>a clear indication of the version of the document, e.g. a version number or publication date, in the body of the licence</li>\n  <li>a statement about compatibility of the licence with common standard licences</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Obviously, custom licences should conform to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendefinition.org/okd/\">open definition</a> and ideally be passed through the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/process/\">licence approval process</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The above recommendations would help stop some of the anti-patterns that are leading to licence proliferation and help the community clearly understand how data can be re-used.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","web_url":"http://theodi.org/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","web_url":"http://theodi.org/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/data-as-culture-2014-in-photographs.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/data-as-culture-2014-in-photographs","slug":"data-as-culture-2014-in-photographs","title":"The launch of Data as Culture 2 in photographs ","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:53+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-25T09:49:07+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/data-as-culture-2014.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/data-as-culture-2014","slug":"data-as-culture-2014","title":"Data as Culture 2014","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:57+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-19T11:49:57+00:00","tag_ids":["page"]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/data-as-culture-who-really-owns-our-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/data-as-culture-who-really-owns-our-data","slug":"data-as-culture-who-really-owns-our-data","title":"Data as Culture: who really owns our data?","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:43:56+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-24T15:40:10+00:00","tag_ids":["news"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"The second Open Data Institute (ODI) Data as Culture exhibition opened its doors yesterday evening (24 March, 2014).

It is a tremendous achievement to ignite the public discussion around inequality, especially in the US.</p>\n\n<p>The book is so promising, some argue &ldquo;Nobel-prize worthy&rdquo;, because it uses historic data such as tax records \u2013 contrary to ungrounded economic theory. Mr Piketty shows in great detail how inequality evolved over the past 300 years. He writes &ldquo;[the] debate about the distribution of wealth has long been based on an abundance of prejudice and a paucity of fact.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This is the great power of data: it undermines purely ideological arguments. As we shape the world\u2019s politics with data, transparency and open access are paramount. Even though the data behind the book is public, it is not open. We would love to see a clear licence, better dissemination and simpler formats to enable everyone to engage in the debate around growing inequality.</p>\n\n<h3>What&rsquo;s in the book?</h3>\n\n<p>Thomas Piketty\u2019s opus magnum includes three major contributions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Piketty collected and analysed historic data and shows in great detail how inequality evolved over the past 300 years.</li>\n  <li>He develops the theoretical ideas of why capitalism has a tendency towards the concentration of wealth and how economies will evolve over time.</li>\n  <li>As an \u201cutopian\u201d solution he proposes a progressive global tax on capital (=wealth).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Among the raving reviews, the book has, not surprisingly, attracted <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21601567-wonky-book-inequality-becomes-blockbuster-bigger-marx\">criticsm</a>. However, even free-market economists have <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/first-thoughts-on-piketty.html\">praised</a> Piketty&rsquo;s foray into the data and history of wealth, whereas the most ardent critics, e.g. a fund manager, simply ignore his &ldquo;<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303825604579515452952131592\">blizzard of data</a>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>At its core, Piketty offers a compelling explanation of the, what MIT professor <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1987/solow.jpg\">Robert Solow</a> calls, \u201crich-get-richer dynamic\u201d. He attacks the political right and financial elites with no hesitation. Surprisingly, they have no real answer to his claims that the current trends towards more inequality are detrimental. The data gives Piketty an almost undisputed case, but others need to be able to use it to, to perform their own analyses and double-check Piketty&rsquo;s claims. </p>\n\n<h3>Where is the data?</h3>\n\n<p>It is highly commendable that Thomas Piketty publishes the underlying Excel files and also the original sources on his <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://piketty.pse.ens.fr\">academic site</a>. If you are search-savvy, you can find the data behind the book in a more accessible format on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.quandl.com/piketty-codes\">Quandl</a>, a data catalogue.</p>\n\n<p>The main source for income data is a dedicated and growing website, the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://topincomes.g-mond.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/\">World Top Incomes Database</a> curated by Piketty and three colleagues. There is a similar dataset at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.lisdatacenter.org/\">Luxembourg Income Study Database (LIS)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Versions of the World Top Incomes Database, such as a full dump on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://datahub.io/dataset/world-top-incomes-database\">datahub.io</a>, can be found on third-party sites. However, we recommend using the original source because it has the most up-to-date data and acknowledges the work that goes into collecting the data.</p>\n\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the problem?</h3>\n\n<p>None of this data is explicitly open for everyone to reuse, clearly licenced and in machine-readable formats.</p>\n\n<p>The data on Piketty&rsquo;s site is buried in the French section only, and full of cumbersome file formats. There is no licensing information on this site to indicate how the data can be reused, nor on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.quandl.com/piketty-codes\">Quandl copy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The results of a major data collection exercise, the rights to the World Top Incomes Database are clear in the copyright statement &ldquo;\u00a9 The World Top Incomes Database.&rdquo; In the absence of an open licence it cannot be used without explicit consent. The availability of downloads and the described terms of attribution implicitly encourage re-use, but without a licence it&rsquo;s not clear whether this is permitted only for research purposes or more widely.</p>\n\n<p>The website and data formats are optimised for humans, with Excel files and point-and-click data selection menus.

We didn&rsquo;t just want to build these systems, we wanted to build them in the right way. We recognised the golden opportunity that we had, with very few legacy systems, to use the best modern technologies in what we built. With no legacy processes, we could Do Agile Right, from the start. And with the ODI&rsquo;s mission-driven focus, we could be completely open about our work at every stage.</p>\n\n<p>I had a further goal. I wanted to demonstrate how to weave open data into the heart of what an organisation does. If we were going to build systems to support our work, open data was going to be at their heart, not an appendix.</p>\n\n<p>So how have we done?</p>\n\n<h2>Small Pieces, Loosely Joined</h2>\n\n<p>One of our <a href=\"\">tech team principles</a> is to borrow mercilessly. We don&rsquo;t want to recreate existing tools and services when we can reuse what&rsquo;s already out there.</p>\n\n<p>One of the joys of starting a new organisation at this point in time is &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an app for that&rdquo;. So we reused those apps: <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/\">Google Apps</a> for our mail, calendars and documents; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/\">Eventbrite</a> to manage our events; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://capsulecrm.com/\">CapsuleCRM</a> to keep track of our contacts; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.xero.com/\">Xero</a> for our finances; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.expensify.com/\">Expensify</a> for our expenses.</p>\n\n<p>But nowadays there&rsquo;s not only an app for that, there&rsquo;s an <em>API</em> for that. Each of these tools provides a mechanism for developers to get hold of the data that they hold, and most also offer ways to <em>create</em> new data. Our job was simply (relatively) to customise the apps and join them together. (There&rsquo;s even <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://zapier.com/\">an app for <em>that</em></a>, but we didn&rsquo;t use it.)</p>\n\n<p>What are the lessons we&rsquo;ve learned from this approach? Well, of course there are trade-offs. We&rsquo;re reliant on services which could disappear, or radically change, outside our control. We have to pay for them, but it would have cost us time and money to develop them ourselves too.</p>\n\n<p>From a data perspective, the most interesting thing is that every service has a completely different way of structuring information about even common things like people or locations. When using APIs, the developer documentation is crucial because they&rsquo;re seldom self-documenting, and existing open source tools and libraries for using the code really smooth the way, even if they&rsquo;re not complete.</p>\n\n<h2>Our Open Data</h2>\n\n<p>Some of the joining that we&rsquo;ve done has required us to expose data. For example, to get the prices of the training courses show on the website or to display information about the lunchtime lectures on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://dashboards.theodi.org/training\">training dashboard</a>. In the new data that we&rsquo;ve generated, we&rsquo;ve adopted the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://schema.org\">schema.org</a> vocabulary where we can.</p>\n\n<p>In other cases, it&rsquo;s been as easy to expose data as not, so we&rsquo;ve done so not because we&rsquo;re using it but in case anyone else wants to. For example, making iCal feeds of the busy/free calendars for our meeting rooms, or JSON versions of the information about our members, is easy to do.</p>\n\n<p>The bits that have proven difficult have exposed some areas where we want to do work. The biggest of these is about how to expose, in a machine-readable way, the licence under which particular data is being made available. We plan to start a small project to create some easy-to-use guidance about associating licences with data.</p>\n\n<p>At a social level, we&rsquo;ve had to think about privacy, confidentiality and commercial considerations. The data generated by the services that we&rsquo;re using is only accessible to us, so we can choose how much to expose and how much to hide. For example, we&rsquo;ve chosen to let everyone see how much our space is being used, but hide information about who is attending meetings in our rooms.</p>\n\n<h2>Our Open Development</h2>\n\n<p>As well as supporting the rest of the team, and publishing open data, the last three months have been an opportunity for us to put into place the tools and practices that make it easy for us to work quickly, create good code, and provide practical contributions to the wider community. The way we work is summarised in these <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.github.io/open-development/talk/#/titlepage\">slides on Open Development</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What Next?</h2>\n\n<p>This has been a really important phase for the team, setting in place the principles of how we work, while getting real work done that has supported the rest of the organisation.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re now looking forward to the next phase, where we turn our sights on to building the tools and practices that should make it easier for people to publish, consume and collaborate over data, based at on the projects that we&rsquo;re doing with our members.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tools-for-working-with-csv-files.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/tools-for-working-with-csv-files","slug":"tools-for-working-with-csv-files","title":"Tools For Working with CSV Files","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:41+01:00","created_at":"2014-01-13T08:21:03+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"Anyone working with open data for any length of time will have inevitably spent a long time wrangling CSV files to tidy, extract and reformat data.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p>Anyone working with open data for any length of time will have inevitably spent a long time wrangling CSV files to tidy, extract and reformat data.</p>\n\n<p>There are various ways to get that job done, but I&rsquo;ve been compiling a list of useful command-line tools that can provide some useful functionality. The ability to automate data conversion and cleaning helps make a process repeatable, which is essential if you&rsquo;re doing more than just a one-off task.</p>\n\n<p>My current favourite tool for working with CSV files is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\">csvkit</a>, which is a collection of utilities that support:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>cleaning CSV files to resolve syntax errors</li>\n  <li>viewing and searching CSV files to extract relevant data</li>\n  <li>generating summaries of columns in the data</li>\n  <li>merging together CSV files, joining them based on common column values</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/getting_started.html\">getting started guide</a> introduces you to each of the tools in turn. Taken together they provide a quick way to inspect the data in a set of CSV files and then combine them to create a more useful structure.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you need to do more detailed clean-up then <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvfix.byethost5.com/csvfix15/csvfix.html\">csvfix</a> might be a better alternative. The documentation includes some <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvfix.byethost5.com/csvfix15/SolutionstoCommonProblems.html\">solutions to common problems</a> which gives a good overview of the functionality. csvfix is particularly good at tidying up and reformatting fields within a CSV file making it a good complement to csvkit.</p>\n\n<p>Of course data is often published as an Excel file rather than as CSV, often requiring a manual step to convert it to CSV before applying other tools. Data might also be spread across separate worksheets, making the export process more laborious. I wrote the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/ldodds/xls-split\">xls-split</a> utility to help extract worksheets from Excel files, converting them into one or more CSV files. Its very useful for extracting data from a set of related spreadsheets, e.g. annual or monthly statistics, in order to then build an aggregate data file.</p>\n\n<p>Validating data in a CSV file, to check that it conforms to expectations, is another common task. This is something that we&rsquo;ve been looking at in more depth at the ODI. This <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/csv-validation-research\">github project</a> and the related documentation explores various tools and approaches for validating CSV files against simple schemas.</p>\n\n<p>If working on the command-line isn&rsquo;t your thing then <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://openrefine.org/\">OpenRefine</a> is still one of the best tools for interactively tidying up messy data.</p>\n\n<p>What other tools do you use when working with CSV files? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","web_url":"http://theodi.org/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Leigh Dodds","slug":"leigh-dodds","web_url":"http://theodi.org/leigh-dodds","tag_ids":[]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/training-odi-it-s-date.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/training-odi-it-s-date","slug":"training-odi-it-s-date","title":"Training at the ODI - It\u2019s a Date","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:44+01:00","created_at":"2013-05-10T16:27:31+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"With Open Data saving our planet for the next generation and bringing forth the next evolution of the web, it was surprising to find that explaining how computers understand dates was one of the most critical parts of the recent Open Data in Practice training course.","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p>With Open Data saving our planet for the next generation and bringing forth the next evolution of the web, it was surprising to find that explaining how computers understand dates was one of the most critical parts of the recent Open Data in Practice training course.</p>\n\n<p>Dates are of critical importance when it comes to processing data but in order for computers to process them, they must first understand them, but even then we still know that things can go wrong as it has for Apple, twice in the last three years (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12104890\">2010/11</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jan/03/apple-do-not-disturb-bug-explained\">2012/13</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Computers like to handle dates as specific objects, conforming to a specific calendar and don\u2019t care much about the human representation. In order to work with dates in a CSV, spreadsheet and even XML first requires the computer to change them all to date objects. Asking graphing tools to plot a date series that hasn\u2019t been translated will normally either result in an error or a best effort where values like 31/2/2013 are perfectly valid as it is just 3 numbers with two /\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>During the validation and cleaning exercises of the open data in practice course we looked at tools to handle date formats, specifically how it is possible to use <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://openrefine.org\">Open Refine</a> to identify errors in the data set. Unfortunately, humans are a pain and will always find a new way to introduce a new representation the computer has never seen before and is unable to translate into a date to be plotted on a graph. \u201cEnd of Q3\u201d in the due date column is a nice example. What year? \u201cBy the end of 2012\u201d is another one. In both cases what was wrong with typing in an actual date!</p>\n\n<p>This\u0002problem with dates became particularly evident for one group on the final day of the Open Data in Practice course. On this day people were asked to apply their new knowledge of open data, tools, techniques and practices to an area of their choice.</p>\n\n<p>The cabinet office team (as they became known) decided to attempt creating a visualisation of the scheduled release of open data from each government department compared to the actual amount of data available. They wanted to see which departments had met their deadlines over time and which were lagging behind.</p>\n\n<p>Stage one was to visualise the intended release schedule, contained in a single dataset available via data.gov.uk. With many potential visualisation toolkits to pick between, and the source data in CSV, it should be fairly strait forward to start working with the data, just like you would in excel. The breakdown to the right shows the approximate amount of time spent on the key tasks in order to create the visualisation. As you can see more time was spent preparing the dataset than actually getting it visualized.</p>\n\n<iframe height=\"350px\" src=\"http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/dt2/odi/training-viz/index2.html\" width=\"400px\"></iframe>\n<p>As well as being a familiar story to scientists and techies, consider the last time you sorted your own email, digital photo collection or computer desktop. Things start out neat and tidy, but the situation changes and that nice filing system you created no longer works for any new content! Surprising that the same applies to such a simple thing as a date format.</p>\n\n<p>Having fixed many of the errors, and given up on others due to sheer boredom, it was time to create the visualisation (shown below). This early version shows the different government departments (y-axis) against the data to be released over time (x-axis). Pressing play will show a series of coloured bubbles moving and growing as the number of datasets gets bigger over time.</p>\n\n<p>DIAGRAM</p>\n\n<p>Notice that there is data missing for many of the departments\u2026 two words\u2026 date format.</p>\n\n<p>Having a week to cover the main issues on open data from licensing, publishing to consumption, validation and visualisation I was extreamely impressed with the projects that were attempted at the end of the week. It is both testament to the people and the community out there who are making the tools much easier to use. We are just beginning to see the evolution of the web of data, but one thing is for sure. If we don\u2019t sort out the problem with dates then we might be stuck in the past\u2026</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"David Tarrant","slug":"david-tarrant","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/david-tarrant","tag_ids":["team","commercial"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"David Tarrant","slug":"david-tarrant","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/david-tarrant","tag_ids":["team","commercial"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/treating-content-as-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/treating-content-as-data","slug":"treating-content-as-data","title":"Treating content as data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:42:43+01:00","created_at":"2014-01-21T09:47:43+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"","excerpt":"At the ODI, you may have noticed that we\u2019ve recently launched a brand new website (you may be reading this blog post on it now).

As well as powering the ODI website, it has the potential to power many other websites from the same backend, such as the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://project.dapaas.eu\">Data as a Platform and Service website</a> (which you may also be reading this blog post on - we can publish to both if we want).</p>\n\n<p>Now, I know this can be done with many commercial and open source CMSs (such as Wordpress for example), but what makes this special is the way the publishing platform is structured. Instead of treating content as web pages to be published as static HTML pages, all content is treated as data.</p>\n\n<p>Before I go on to describe what I mean by this, I&rsquo;ll give you a little tour of our architecture. As I mentioned before, we use the same platform that is used for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gov.uk\">gov.uk</a>, which is effectively four Ruby on Rails apps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/signonotron2\">Signonotron</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/panopticon\">Panopticon</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/publisher\">Publisher</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/content_api\">Content API</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Signonotron manages users, Panopticon manages page creation and metadata, Publisher manages the actual content of pages and publication, and content API serves up the content in JSON format, which is then consumed by the frontends.</p>\n\n<p>This is what I mean by treating content as data. If you append <code>.json</code> to this page&rsquo;s URL (or any other page on the site), you&rsquo;ll be redirected to the content API. This isn&rsquo;t just a JSON representation of the content you&rsquo;re reading, we&rsquo;re eating our own dogfood. If you look at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/frontend-www\">source code</a> for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/dapaas-frontend\">both sites</a>, you&rsquo;ll see there&rsquo;s no database behind either.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the way the platform is structured, it&rsquo;s therefore pretty trivial to serve up content to multiple frontends (this was, in fact, one of the main reasons for choosing to fork the GDS code in the first place). We set up a Rails app, templated it (using another GDS project - <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/alphagov/slimmer\">Slimmer</a>), and we&rsquo;re good to go. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, after a few tweaks to the core Panopticon and Content API code, the DaPaaS frontend was built in the space of a day - far quicker than having to set up and template a brand new Wordpress or Drupal instance, and much more maintainable.</p>\n\n<p>As our work continues at the ODI, we&rsquo;ll also be building more frontends to aid our work, making the publishing platform more than a Content Management System, it&rsquo;s the beating heart at the core of our organisation.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":" ","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Stuart Harrison","slug":"stuart-harrison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-harrison","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Stuart Harrison","slug":"stuart-harrison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/stuart-harrison","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/uk-leads-demand-open-data-odi-opens-business.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/uk-leads-demand-open-data-odi-opens-business","slug":"uk-leads-demand-open-data-odi-opens-business","title":"UK Leads Demand for Open Data as ODI Opens for Business","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:14+01:00","created_at":"2012-12-02T18:46:08+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"As The Open Data Institute opens officially, research reveals key features of an evolving open data market.

In taking leadership positions, Virgin Media and Which? are demonstrating their commitment to meeting the needs of 21st Century consumers. Like you and I, consumers are increasingly connected and have high expectations of products and services, their convenience, innovation, relevance, privacy, transparency, and support. Using open data can provide credible insight to help organisations provide better services to their customers, and unlock innovation by engaging beyond their in-house capabilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Professor Nigel Shadbolt, co-founder and Chairman of the ODI, said:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese two new relationships signify a key moment for the ODI and demonstrate that open data is crucial to the future success of brands. We welcome Virgin Media and Which? and look forward to helping unlock the value of open data for them and their customers.

Membership fees start from \u00a3540/year for supporters, up to \u00a350,000/year for partners, a proportion may be paid in-kind through the contribution of services, technology or other expertise.\u0002\nMembers receive vouchers that they can redeem against training and other professional services, as well as a 20% discount on future services. Benefits also include access to the growing open data community based at the ODI offices in Shoreditch, London, networking events, and collaboration on projects that create economic, environmental, and social value.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/join-us\">More details are available</a> for those interested in joining the ODI\u0002\n<em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://video.ft.com/v/2236575765001/Start-ups-tap-into-open-data\">See how</a> FT.Com covered the story</em></p>\n\n<p><em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/new-industrialists-part-2-open-data-market-makers\">Read a blog </a>by the ODI&rsquo;s Stuart Coleman on the businesses that are making an open data market</em></p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Emma Thwaites","slug":"emma-thwaites","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/emma-thwaites","tag_ids":["operations","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/what-do-statisticians-think-big-data.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/what-do-statisticians-think-big-data","slug":"what-do-statisticians-think-big-data","title":"What Do Statisticians Think Of Big Data?","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:42+01:00","created_at":"2013-04-25T23:19:51+01:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":null,"content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/bdw13.png\" alt=\"Big Data Week\" /></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://bigdataweek.com/\">Big Data Week</a>\u0002just happened, in London and around the globe. And as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/03/29/nate-silver-gets-real-about-big-data\">others</a> before me have pointed out, it has become <em>de rigueur</em> to ascribe all sorts of supernatural powers to big data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There is a sentiment that if you have enough data you are bound to get the right answer.</strong>\u0002A\u0002statistician will tell you more is <em>not</em> necessarily better; something also a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/blog/what-is-data-science-really\">data scientist</a>, a software engineer or a business person may tell you, but probably less emphatically.</p>\n\n<p>I have a feeling statisticians\u0002tend towards cynicism, perhaps because you realise how much randomness is out there. Patterns that seem miraculous, like three children born on the same day <em>in one familiy</em>, are almost expected in a population the size of the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Probabilities are not intuitive. Numerous examples show us why, for example: How many people do you need to invite to your party, for a 50/50 chance, that two are born on the same day? [1] But this is a topic for another day, back to the wonders of big data.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the statistical community supports the Big Data Week because we recognise the enormous potential of large data sets. We can find <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.quora.com/Google/What-do-statisticians-do-at-Google\">statisticians at Google</a> and there are many parallels between statisticians and big data analysts (who might call themselves something else).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/stats.jpg\" alt=\"\" />2013 is the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.statistics2013.org/\">Year of Statistics</a>. \u0002But what is statistics? While I don&rsquo;t want to answer this question here, I find that Bradley Efron is a great source for bits of wisdom: &ldquo;Statistics is the science of information gathering, especially when the information arrives in little pieces instead of big ones.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>My vision is that the data arrives in little, <strong>open</strong> pieces. Then we can stick them together and create big data. In fact, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2013/04/22/forget-big-data-small-data-is-the-real-revolution/\">Rufus Pollock</a> from the Open Knowledge Foundation goes one step further: &ldquo;forget big data, small data is the real revolution&rdquo;. He points out that size doesn&rsquo;t matter and that we should focus on a distributed ecosystem of information.</p>\n\n<p>We can summarise my statistical view on big data quite succinctly with:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bigger Data &permil;Better Data</strong></p>\n\n<p>For big data to be <em>better data</em> it needs to</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>solve relevant problems,</li>\n  <li>keep noise, bias and spurious results at a minimum,</li>\n  <li>and, crucially, have a team of researchers who are able to understand it fully.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Big data advocates envision a world where we are free of hyptheses, or even the scientific method, and simply &ldquo;let the data speak&rdquo;. Indeed, we should leave plenty of room for methods that are not model-based. However, data is not neutral. We have to <strong>interpret</strong> it.</p>\n\n<p>Nate Silver, the current poster boy of statisticians, writes in his book <em>The Signal and the Noise</em> about big data:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The numbers have no way of speaking for themselves. We speak for them. We imbue them with meaning. [\u2026] Before we demand more of our data, we have to demand more of ourselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He shows, for example, how more data has only hardened the sides in a political divide. Similarly, more data within the global warming research helped little to resolve the debate. On the other hand, Silver is actually known for his forecast models and smart predictions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, are we excited about big data?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It depends.</p>\n\n<p>(A statistician&rsquo;s answer to most questions.)</p>\n\n<p>\u0002\n- - - - - -</p>\n\n<p>[1] That\u2019s right: 23.

An example explains what this means in practice.</em></strong> <em>The case study below is adapted from Brian Ballsun-Stanton\u2019s PhD thesis</em> Asking about data. <em>He is an experimental philosopher and works as a data architect. I thank him for his permission to use it.</em></p>\n\n<p>I am a practitioner. Why, then, engage in philosophical questions? It sharpens your mind. You can use fun words like <em>geist</em> and <em>epistemological</em>. And, it can offer clarity in discussions about data and may help to resolve &ldquo;silos&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is data?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Brian Ballsun-Stanton writes in his PhD thesis <em>Asking about data</em>: &ldquo;I noticed that practitioners use and understand the term \u2018data\u2019 differently than the people they are helping.&rdquo; [1] He describes three philosophies of data. Before we explore them, here is a recent case study.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Imagine you are a tech team building a new online platform from scratch. Your <em>umwelt</em> (environment/surroundings) is data. You have great financial and intellectual freedom to build something that reflects the needs of users. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A main feature of the desired architecture is often vocalised as &ldquo;everything is data&rdquo; and \u201cwe want to employ <em>all</em> the data\u201d. But what do the parties involved mean by this? Would different concepts of data lead to different platforms?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Everything is data&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>For purposes of this case study consider three team members. Mr O, Ms S and Ms C have different backgrounds and depart in their inherent concept of data. </p>\n\n<p>Mr O is part of the executive team and understands data as &ldquo;facts&rdquo;. The platform, for example, should deliver objective numbers about page impressions. He admits we could collect and analyse all sorts of data, but is least comfortable with unstructured text. Mr O would say: \u201cData are measurable, small, recorded descriptions of the world.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ms S is part of the commercial team and acknowledges the value of relevant metrics. However, for her, the intangibles of user satisfaction are equally important. She is interested in how to decode human communications and would be happy to work with purely qualitative data. Ms S would say: &ldquo;Live music is also data.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Ms C is part of the tech team and recognises all digital records to be data. She considers data to be encoded human communications or encoded information. The online platform exists as a digital product, so Ms C understands <em>everything is data</em> in the most literal and exhaustive sense. Ms C would say: &ldquo;Data is a bucket for information and knowledge.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How people expect data to work</strong></p>\n\n<p>For Mr O data are objective measurements. He trusts in statistics to extract meaning from data and would feel least at ease with a database of unstructured text without the benefits of a semantic analysis. Mr O may be aware of meta-data, but he sees them as separate records from the actual measurements, thus, secondary. Mr O wants data streams that can directly feed into dashboards.</p>\n\n<p>Ms S, as someone who holds data as subjective observations, is nominally &ldquo;okay&rdquo; with &ldquo;anything&rdquo; in the database. Ms S especially dislikes a database that is not internally consistent. If one blog post has a second title there is no point in recording that as a separate field. Only if reality changes, that is most blog post have two titles, the database structure should be updated. Ms S wants a flexible commenting system like Juvia, where visitor comments are recorded as data.</p>\n\n<p>Ms C considers the database a repository of human interactions that is curated and made discoverable by other humans. Any design that interferes with that curation or hobbles the maintainer is discouraged. Because for Ms C the database carries value in itself, she is comfortable with whatever best supports human communication. Ms C wants every aspect of the platform itself to be accessible as data, for example, as machine-readable json.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Three philosophies of data</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ballsun-Stanton&rsquo;s explorations identify three philosophies of data. In his studies people describe data</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>as <em>objective facts</em>, measurements revealing the relationships of reality (Mr O);</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>as <em>subjective observations</em>, sense-impressions filtered by knowledge (Ms S); and</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>as <em>communications</em>, a container for meaning (Ms C). </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While individuals may not &ldquo;have philosophies&rdquo;, they express their understanding of data through language and actions. For example, those who treat data as objective facts will treat of a spreadsheet full of temperature measurements as data, but would not accept subjective description such as &ldquo;warm&rdquo; or &ldquo;hot&rdquo;. Rather than being distinct categories theses concepts are on a spectrum. I encourage the interested reader to dive into a short, readable paper <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=filetype%3Apdf+Asking+about+data+experimental+philosophy+researchgate\"><em>Asking about Data</em></a> for more. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Quirkafleeg</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t guessed it by now: in the case study we are, of course, talking about the Open Data Institute and the new platform, codename quirkafleeg. Our internal communications took into account all three philosophies. Being aware of different understandings of data avoids silos and serves our motto <em>Knowledge for everyone</em>. We can admire a platform that looks great and is built in an open way.</p>\n\n<p>We can also answer the question &ldquo;what is data?&rdquo; not by personal philosophies but with a pragmatic claim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data is the raw material of the information age.</strong></p>\n\n<p>[1] Ballsun-Stanton, B.

They are things we create. And the data we choose to collect determines the value that we eventually get.</p>\n\n<p>So I prefer to liken datasets to roads. Roads are things we choose to build because they enable us to get from A to B, just like datasets enable us to find the information we need to make better decisions. We, as a society, have done a bit of thinking and planning and worked out which roads are really important. We\u2019ve given them names like \u2018M25\u2019 and invested time, effort and resources in expanding or improving existing roads or adding new ones to make journeys easier.</p>\n\n<p>But the transformational property of roads is that they have junctions. Roads that don\u2019t join with other roads can only take you between two places, but a network of connected roads can take you anywhere the roads reach.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/legacy/spaghetti%2Djunction.jpg\" alt=\"Spaghetti Junction\" /><br />\n<small><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/highwaysagency/6194409693\">Photo of Spaghetti Junction</a> by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/highwaysagency/\">Highways Agency</a></small></p>\n\n<p>If we were to look at the UK\u2019s National Information Infrastructure as a road network, what we\u2019d see at the moment is a mix of bumpy dirt tracks (data hidden in PDFs), slightly smoother byways (data presented in Excel files), and a few well-paved, high speed motorways (data provided as data), many of which charge a toll to use. There would be relatively few junctions (links between datasets), and what junctions there were would generally be hard to navigate.</p>\n\n<p>We need more trunk roads in our National Information Infrastructure: more of the datasets we frequently use need to be easy to access and process. We need more junctions too: the core datasets should provide ways of travelling from one dataset to another. It\u2019s not that other datasets aren\u2019t important or interesting \u2014 they absolutely are, and in fact they\u2019re probably more engaging than the monotony of a motorway \u2014 it\u2019s just that it\u2019s much harder to travel without trunk roads.</p>\n\n<p>The equivalent to trunk roads with lots of junctions in the National Information Infrastructure is <strong>core reference data</strong>. Core reference data is data about the things</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>that are <strong>referenced</strong> from other information \u2014 these references are the junctions onto the byways of statistical and administrative data</li>\n  <li>where each item is assigned an <strong>identifier</strong>, such as a number or code, to make it easy to reference and therefore create a junction with other datasets</li>\n  <li>where lists of them are probably maintained through some <strong>defined processes</strong> which ensures the roads and junctions themselves get maintained</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Trunk roads need to be composed of the right materials to enable an easy journey: we don\u2019t want our smooth tarmaced motorways to be covered in gravel. In the same way, core reference data needs to contain core information, which tends to</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be <strong>non-numeric</strong> (not counts or percentages)</li>\n  <li><strong>change infrequently</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and not be combined with statistical and administrative information which tends to</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be <strong>numeric</strong> (counts or percentages)</li>\n  <li><strong>change rapidly</strong> over time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Identifying the things about which core reference data needs to be made available isn\u2019t hard. They are the things around us, that make society function. They are the things that we collect information about in registers. They are the things that all the information we collect and use is really about. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>registered companies</li>\n  <li>courts</li>\n  <li>the river network</li>\n  <li>schools &amp; academies</li>\n  <li>power stations</li>\n  <li>polling stations</li>\n  <li>hospitals</li>\n  <li>job centres</li>\n  <li>bus stops</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve created a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/shared/wiki/National-Information-Infrastructure-Datasets\">longer list on our wiki</a>, which is still unlikely to be complete, based on the datasets whose release was targeted within the G8 Open Data Charter.</p>\n\n<p>These datasets aren\u2019t particularly big or complicated. Most of them will just have a few fields: an identifier, a name, a location or boundary, a category. But they are important as connective datasets that enable developers to traverse other, richer and deeper data.</p>\n\n<p>Like trunk roads, some core datasets might need to be built from scratch. New junctions might need to be created between datasets to make them more useful. Like trunk roads, these datasets need to be provided to a high standard; our ideal is for them to be published at the Expert level of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open Data Certificate</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A plan to progress a National Information Infrastructure should be considering these datasets and work out whether each exists in the first place, whether it\u2019s published, how well it\u2019s published (including how easy it is to find and whether it\u2019s available as open data), and how that publication will be improved. Just as our road network requires continuing investment, so will our information infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Creating a list of datasets isn\u2019t hard, just like creating a list of roads isn\u2019t hard. The real challenge for government is to construct a realistic and coherent plan for how our National Information Infrastructure should look \u2014 which roads should be trunk roads and where the junctions should be \u2014 and to see it through.</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Jeni Tennison","slug":"jeni-tennison","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison","tag_ids":["team","executive","technical"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/what-is-data-science-really.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/what-is-data-science-really","slug":"what-is-data-science-really","title":"What is Data Science, Really?","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:41:29+01:00","created_at":"2013-02-07T17:43:35+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"When I told friends and family about my new job as a \u2018data scientist\u2019 at the Open Data Institute, most of them said \u201cwhat\u2019s a data scientist?\u201d.

Most of them also asked &ldquo;what&rsquo;s open data?&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s already well covered <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/guide/what-open-data\">elsewhere</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Much has been written in trying to define the term &lsquo;data science&rsquo;. Unfortunately, even <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06/what-is-data-science.html\">seminal (and otherwise excellent) articles</a> bury a concise definition of the term among descriptions of the characteristics, methods or responsibilities of data scientists, rather than defining the discipline itself. So much has already been written that I hesitate to add more. But I read these definitions, find them lacking, and feel compelled to attempt my own. Deep in the article linked above is this passage:</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Data science isn&rsquo;t just about the existence of data, or making guesses about what that data might mean; it&rsquo;s about testing hypotheses and making sure that the conclusions you&rsquo;re drawing from the data are valid.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this simply describes &lsquo;science&rsquo;, and in that redundancy lies the problem with the term &lsquo;data science&rsquo; as it is typically used.  </p>\n\n<p>For me there is a precedent in naming sciences, that follows the pattern &lsquo;{topic} science&rsquo;. Therefore &lsquo;biological science&rsquo; is the scientific study of organisms and biological processes; it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;doing science using biology&rsquo;. Similarly &lsquo;computer science&rsquo; is the scientific study of computing rather than simply &lsquo;doing science using computers&rsquo;.  </p>\n\n<p>If we apply the same analysis to data science, the discipline should amount to the scientific study of data, not &lsquo;doing science with data&rsquo;; there&rsquo;s nothing new in that, but this is how many seem to interpret the term. There are certainly many data scientists delivering novel insights to their organisations through rigorous data analysis, often using tools, techniques or data volumes that were previously inconceivable &ndash; but if done rigorously this amounts to &lsquo;behavioural science&rsquo; more than the science of data itself.</p>\n\n<p>This ambiguity is one of the reasons that I love the term &lsquo;<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://andrewchen.co/2012/04/27/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/\">growth hacker</a>&rsquo;. Not only does it capture the aims of the role but also something of the methods used. The same can&rsquo;t necessarily be said of &lsquo;data scientist&rsquo;, unfortunately.  </p>\n\n<p>So where does that leave me as Data Scientist at the ODI? If I apply the common interpretation of data science then there is a whole world of opportunity in the wealth of open data being released by government and others. &lsquo;Doing science&rsquo; with that data is an opportunity to study issues and answer questions that could impact all members of our society for the better, which is an incredible challenge and privilege. It also raises some interesting challenges relative to data science in a corporate world, where you may own and control the data through its entire lifecycle, but I&rsquo;ll deal with that in a future post.  </p>\n\n<p>If I apply my alternative interpretation of data science as the scientific study of data and how it manifests in the 21st century, then a very different range of possibilities emerges, where we study the characteristics, interconnections, and applications of data in order to maximise the value that can be derived from it.  </p>\n\n<p>Naturally I&rsquo;m delighted that both of these directions are on the agenda at the ODI. These are exciting times to be a data scientist, whatever your interpretation!</p>\n","media_enquiries_name":null,"media_enquiries_email":null,"media_enquiries_telephone":null,"alternative_title":null,"organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Tom Heath","slug":"tom-heath","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/tom-heath","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Tom Heath","slug":"tom-heath","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/tom-heath","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/the-status-of-csvs-on-datagovuk.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/blog/the-status-of-csvs-on-datagovuk","slug":"the-status-of-csvs-on-datagovuk","title":"What is a CSV?

We had to clean up plenty of names because in its raw format, it is <em>messy data</em> such as &ldquo;amount&rdquo;, &ldquo; amount&rdquo;, &ldquo;AMUONT&rdquo; etc. After some <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://openrefine.org\">Open Refine</a> magic, we produced the following rank table. </p>\n\n<table class=\"table offers table-horizontally-condensed\">\n <tr><td>Expense Type</td><td class=\"pull-right\">3,144</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Entity</td><td class=\"pull-right\">3,039</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Expense Area</td><td class=\"pull-right\">3,029</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Supplier</td><td class=\"pull-right\">2,889</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Date</td><td class=\"pull-right\">2,820</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Transaction Number</td><td class=\"pull-right\">2,791</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Amount</td><td class=\"pull-right\">2,734</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Department Family</td><td class=\"pull-right\">2,498</td></tr>\n <tr><td>VAT Registration Number</td><td class=\"pull-right\">916</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Convictions Percentage</td><td class=\"pull-right\">836</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>The headers may not be representative overall because it only features the machine-readable CSVs. They are frequency counts which also implies that departments that release similar data in individual CSVs (e.g. for each month) are overrepresented. Be that as it may, the header ranking shows how common certain data types are.</p>\n\n<h4>Figure 4. Co-occurrence of header names</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/theodi/R-projects/master/csv-stats/co-occurrence/top-headers-coocc.png\" alt=\"header-map\" /></p>\n\n<p>We took the 50 most popular header names and calculated how often they each appear together. The lines&rsquo; thickness stands for the frequency of their co-occurence. For example, as we would expect, <em>Payscale Minimum</em> and <em>Payscale Maximum</em> are next to each other. A generic header name such as <em>Unit</em> appears in many files and has therefore stronger links to various others.</p>\n\n<p>The most common cluster is around <em>Expense Type</em> because many files document government spending. A typical &ldquo;Spend over \u00a325,000&rdquo; CSV is very likely to have similar headers as listed in the previous table. </p>\n\n<p>We also see an independent cluster around prosecutions. For example, the Crown Prosecution Service releases a lot of individual CSVs, which increases how many times they appear in our header analysis. </p>\n\n<h4>Figure 5. Co-occurrence of header names excluding popular datasets</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/theodi/R-projects/master/csv-stats/co-occurrence/top-headers-coocc-excl-popular.png\" alt=\"header-map2\" /></p>\n\n<p>Figure 5 shows the co-occurrence of headers excluding popular datasets. For example, CSVs with <em>Expense Type</em> no longer appear. Here the 200 most popular header names reveal quite a tangle. The large, overplotted area on the bottom are CSV headers, among others, from the BIS Workforce Management Information.</p>\n\n<p>The big cluster on the right, dubbed the &ldquo;Death Star&rdquo;, comes from one series of CSVs. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/dataset/foreign-office-consular-data\">Foreign Office Consular</a> publishes &ldquo;data on assistance provided to British nationals worldwide this includes numbers of incidents handled by UK consulates overseas, including hospitalisations, deaths, detentions, with geographical location&rdquo;. </p>\n\n<p>A similar cluster appears on the top left published by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/dataset/latest-marine-observational-data\">Metoffice</a>. It includes the latest 24 hours marine data for observed weather. Both exemplify why some headers are more related than others: a publisher may release many almost identical files split by time or geography.</p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>We appreciate that more and more people recognise CSV as a desirable format for sharing data on the web. However, publishing any tabular data simply with a <code>.csv</code> extension will not bring as much further. The key is to follow a minimal standard. Tools for doing so are emerging, for instance the ODI&rsquo;s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://csvlint.io/\">CSV validator</a>. As Jeni wrote, 2014 may turn out to be the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/2014-the-year-of-csv\">Year of the CSV</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our analysis is far from exhaustive relative to the open data ecosystem; it only looks at data.gov.uk. Even there we have to acknowledge certain limitations such as incorrect headers or temporarily unavailable URLs. What it shows us, however, is that few publishers follow leading practice yet. </p>\n\n<p>By making access and aggregation of data via CSV easier, we enable a huge potential. For example, only an automated analysis may be able to look at the spending across all government departments and bring the often proclaimed transparency. Companies may use CSVs to integrate them into their dashboards or to build services. Even non-technical citizens may be able to use the data more easily. Many user-friendly tools such as <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://datawrapper.de/\">Datawrapper</a> have CSV features built-in. </p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s aim for a world with less <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling\">data munging</a>.</p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Ulrich Atz","slug":"ulrich-atz","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/ulrich-atz","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Ulrich Atz","slug":"ulrich-atz","web_url":"http://theodi.org/team/ulrich-atz","tag_ids":["technical","team"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/11m-boost-open-data-innovation.json","web_url":"http://theodi.org/news/11m-boost-open-data-innovation","slug":"11m-boost-open-data-innovation","title":"\u00a31.1m Boost for Open Data Innovation","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:40:18+01:00","created_at":"2012-12-14T10:13:21+00:00","tag_ids":["news"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/tags/articles/news.json","web_url":null,"title":"News Item","details":{"description":"News Item","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.theodi.org/with_tag.json?article=news","web_url":"http://theodi.org/browse/news","slug":"news"},"parent":null}],"related":[],"details":{"need_id":"","business_proposition":false,"description":null,"excerpt":"Start-ups and small businesses hoping to build products and services from open data are getting the chance to apply for a new wave of Innovation Vouchers.

The format: we host a talk from an expert about the meaning and impact of open data and you bring your lunch and your questions.</p>\n\n<p>Every Friday at 1pm there\u2019s a great buzz in the office when our attendees turn up and fill our boardroom. It\u2019s been really exciting to see the community grow over the last few months and we now have a large, global network of open data enthusiasts who we connect with both in person and online. \u0002\nA personal favourite was <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/132404337/How-to-create-more-value-from-government-open-data\">David Mitton from Listpoint\u2019s talk </a>on unlocking value from government data. Using the national police database as a case study David showed really clearly how opening up data had helped reduce IT costs via streamlining code lists and outlined the potential savings which could be made in the future.</p>\n\n<p>I was lucky enough to attend the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/courses/open-data-practice\">Open Data in Practice</a> training course in July. The best bits were getting my hands dirty with some data mining; taking data sets and cleaning them with Google Refine.</p>\n\n<p>It helped me appreciate the journey we have to go on to get data presented in a useable and useful format as well as opening it up. I couldn\u2019t believe how much cleaning was required of some datasets which were already in the public domain. It made me realise the huge value of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">ODI Open Data Certificates</a> as a benchmark for open data standards.</p>\n\n<p>So, in the spirit of openness, here are our first two terms of training in numbers:</p>\n\n<p>\u0002\n- 65,665 people browsed our Friday lunchtime lecture slides on<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.scribd.com/OpenDataInstitute\"> Scribd</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/theODI\">Slideshare</a>\n- 890 cups coffee drunk at our lectures and courses\n- 729 people attended our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures\">Friday lunchtime lectures</a>\n- 324 pieces of sushi consumed\n- 290 biscuits munched\n- 86 people trained\n- 53 <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\">data.gov.uk</a> datasets mined\n- 22 lunchtime lectures hosted\n- 4 public training courses launched\n- And <em>finally</em> some of you (803 to be precise) are starting to listen to our audio content on<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/theodi\"> Soundcloud</a>! \u0002\n\u0002\nI\u2019d personally like to thank the ODI training team, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/kcorrick\">Kathryn Corrick</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/davetaz\">Dave Tarrant </a>and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/langphil\">Phil Lang</a> for being such brilliant and creative people to work with.
